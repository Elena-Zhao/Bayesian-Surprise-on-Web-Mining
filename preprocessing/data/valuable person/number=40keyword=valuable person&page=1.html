I know that nothing technically has value, but why did the whole world choose to give gold so much value? Its really used for nothing. When is the last time you have ever heard someone say they needed gold? never, cause it is useless. Do you think, back in the day, people first started giving it value because it was shining? I know that sounds dumb, but i think its a possibility. <br />Also, do you think we could do away with the money system? like go back to trading or something like that? I know that it is theoretically possible, but i guess im asking how probable you think it is. I really dislike money (and gold i guess). I wish i could live my life without money, in my experiences money has done more bad than good. But no matter how much i dislike money, i am forced to give it value. I find it kind of upsetting, i don't want to give value to money, i really don't. But because just about every person on this earth continues to see money as value, i also have too. I feel changing a system like this will never happen, but do you think it could? and do you think it should?</p>	</div>		<div id="conversation">		<div id="discussion" class="silverBorderPanel">						<div class="comment-container">			<ul class="l-0" id="commentList-9999"><li id="id-511373" class="comment">		<a name="511373">	<div class="comment">					<a href="/profiles/1222387" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.tedcdn.com/r/s3.amazonaws.com/ted.conferences.profiles/00/00/02/85/c9/165321.jpg?w=50&h=50&op=%5E&c=50%2C50" alt="thumb" class="profile" /></a>				<div class="commentHeader">		<h4>			<a href="/profiles/1222387" target="_blank" class="notranslate">peter lindsay</a>		</h4>		<ul class="actions">			<li class="notranslate score pos">+1</li>		</ul>	</div>	<div class="flairWrap">			</div>	<div class="commentBody notranslate">		<span class="date">			Aug 9 2012:		</span>		<span class="commentText">It is by far the most common of the metals that don't corrode and is an interesting colour for a metal. That's why the ancient world used it for jewllery and artifacts. It is immortal like a god, a gold figurine lasts for ever. Today as well as its monetary use it is widely used in industry. Every chip in the computer you are currently using is wired up with gold wire as it is the most ductile of metals. Without gold your mobile phone would be twice the size as all the circuitry would have to be larger to accommidate the thicker copper wire, and the copper wire would eventually corrode.</span>	</div>	</li><li id="id-511244" class="comment">		<a name="511244">	<div class="comment">				<div class="commentHeader">		<h4>			<a href="/profiles/828340" target="_blank" class="notranslate">gale kooser</a>		</h4>		<ul class="actions">			<li class="notranslate score pos">+1</li>		</ul>	</div>	<div class="flairWrap">			</div>	<div class="commentBody notranslate">		<span class="date">			Aug 8 2012:		</span>		<span class="commentText">Yes! I know what you mean & agree. As for folks bartering in USA: It's all around you, you just haven't noticed it yet.<br />Ask around & it will surprise you I bet.<br />Ex.: I am a wildlife artist & someone wants a painting of their dog or cat but can't afford it. I don't own a car but still have my driver's license. Outcome: They get their painting & I get use/or they drive their car for how ever amount of time & or distance is agreed upon. Simple as that!<br />Ex.: You need a hair cut but can't afford it. You have a friend who is good at cutting hair. Your friend needs something that you can supply. Outcome you get a hair cut & he/or she gets the item. I know, I know, I just explained the barter system, but that example is going on around you on a daily basis in this country. I bet if you talked to a few of your friends (young & older) you would get an ear full.</span>	</div>	</li><li id="id-511007" class="comment">		<a name="511007">	<div class="comment">					<a href="/profiles/303148" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.tedcdn.com/r/s3.amazonaws.com/ted.conferences.profiles/00/00/02/60/6d/155757.jpg?w=50&h=50&op=%5E&c=50%2C50" alt="thumb" class="profile" /></a>				<div class="commentHeader">		<h4>			<a href="/profiles/303148" target="_blank" class="notranslate">Krisztián Pintér</a>		</h4>		<ul class="actions">			<li class="notranslate score pos">+1</li>		</ul>	</div>	<div class="flairWrap">		<a href="/pages/conversations_badges" class="flair translator notranslate" title="This user is a TED volunteer translator.">TED Translator</a>	</div>	<div class="commentBody notranslate">		<span class="date">			Aug 8 2012:		</span>		<span class="commentText">the answer is mises' regression theory. gold is valuable today because it was valuable yesterday, and people see no reason why would it change suddenly. of course the regression is not infinite, at some point in history the value of gold was its decoration and prestige value.<br /><br />nobody sees money as a real value. everyone understands that money has value because you can buy things with it, and things have value. any sane person when thinks about 10 bucks thinks about hamburgers and movie tickets.<br /><br />system change can't fix that. you either want a movie ticket or not. money is involved or not in the process makes no fundamental difference. probably you dream about a system in which you can just walk into a cinema, and watch a movie for free. won't happen, friend. many many people are working on those movies, and they want to eat just as you do. reciprocity.</span>	</div>	</li><li id="id-511004" class="comment">		<a name="511004">	<div class="comment">					<a href="/profiles/968790" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.tedcdn.com/r/s3.amazonaws.com/ted.conferences.profiles/00/00/02/3c/94/146580.jpg?w=50&h=50&op=%5E&c=50%2C50" alt="thumb" class="profile" /></a>				<div class="commentHeader">		<h4>			<a href="/profiles/968790" target="_blank" class="notranslate">Fritzie -</a>		</h4>		<ul class="actions">			<li class="notranslate score pos">+1</li>		</ul>	</div>	<div class="flairWrap">		<a href="/pages/conversations_badges" class="flair moderator notranslate" title="This user helps guide TED Conversations.">Host</a>	</div>	<div class="commentBody notranslate">		<span class="date">			Aug 8 2012:		</span>		<span class="commentText">A combination of rarity, desirability, and usefulness gives something economic value.

Being shiny was a big draw for earlier humans. Ever hear- "Worth its weight in gold?" That's one reason we have a Federal reserve.<br />As for dropping a monetary system? We are sort of headed that way now with all the plastic/online stuff - deposits/pay bills etc.  <br />As for what I think:  Could or should?

That's what i was referring to when i said "trading." I have something you want, you have something i want.... lets make a deal! As far as I'm aware, that's the basis of the bartering system. But this system seems out dated, so to speak. I understand how/why bartering would still be used today in developing countries. The only example of this in the US, that i have seen or aware of, is the family that owns the corner store down the road from me. They pay people who help them with food, cigarettes, and alcohol. Which i assume isn't the only case of this around the US. If you don't mind, could you give me some more examples of bartering in the US? I would really appreciate it.<br />Also, the whole "plastic/online stuff" isn't really getting away from a monetary system, in my eyes. I see all that as just making it more complex. The numbers that back up the plastic cards, and that are seen online, just represent the amount of money you have, which the money is backed with gold. No gold, no imaginary numbers...
