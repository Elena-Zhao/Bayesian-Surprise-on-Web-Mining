He is the most courageous, religious, and selfless person I have ever known. My father had passed away when I was fifteen years old. He had died of T-cell lymphoma.

In 1996, when I was in fifth grade we found out that my father had cancer. He told me not to worry and that he was going to be well soon. I believed him because to me he was invisible. Instead of getting better he got worse and worse as the days go by, but never once did he stop fighting.</p><p>My father was a very religious person.
