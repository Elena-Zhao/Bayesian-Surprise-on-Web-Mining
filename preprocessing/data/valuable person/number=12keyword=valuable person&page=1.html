But are certain people more valuable than others? If yes; can we measure this?</h2>	<p>Questions I raised when I asked myself this question:<br />- Do people know what is best for themselves?<br />- Is there really such a thing as universal worth of a person?<br />- What, really, are credentials?<br />- Are people really good and/or bad?<br />- Are Myers Briggs personality type differences causing me (or you) to believe another person is worth less than me (or you)?<br />- Is it possible to measure the worth of a person retrospectively?<br />- Does answering the first question with a yes make me (or you) pretentious?<br />- Am I going to answer this question by generalizing and placing people into categories and become a statistician; labeling everyone possessing a certain characteristic as less valuable?<br />- Is it possible to spend "too much" time thinking about questions like these? Less think, more do?<br />- Breadth of a person or depth of a person?<br />- Best way to test a person's value is to test their ability to lead?<br />- A great follower is better than an average leader?<br />- Why does linguistic ability play such a large role in determining the value of a person? Is it overvalued?<br />- Does most of society not realize it's answering this question in the affirmative with most of its actions, and by extension raising a lot of unanswered, difficult questions? eg, job interviews, exams, tests, college applications, credit.<br />- Do xNTP's not realize that the rest of the world doesn't believe that intelligence is the main factor to contribute to a person's worth?<br />- Is the person reading this going to realize that this is my first TED question?<br /><br />Please don't bother answering all of the additional questions unless you truly have nothing better to do with your time. :P</p>	</div>		<div id="conversation">		<div id="discussion" class="silverBorderPanel">						<div class="comment-container">			<ul class="l-0" id="commentList-9999"><li id="id-444851" class="comment">		<a name="444851">	<div class="comment">					<a href="/profiles/960898" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.tedcdn.com/r/s3.amazonaws.com/ted.conferences.profiles/00/00/01/cc/1b/117787.jpg?w=50&h=50&op=%5E&c=50%2C50" alt="thumb" class="profile" /></a>				<div class="commentHeader">		<h4>			<a href="/profiles/960898" target="_blank" class="notranslate">Daniel Vais</a>		</h4>		<ul class="actions">			<li class="notranslate score pos">+1</li>		</ul>	</div>	<div class="flairWrap">		<a href="/pages/conversations_badges" class="flair tedx_organizer notranslate" title="This user is a TEDx organizer.">TEDx Organizer</a>	</div>	<div class="commentBody notranslate">		<span class="date">			Apr 11 2012:		</span>		<span class="commentText">We are all valuable is different ways. no one is more valuable then other.  <br />problems starts when we think someone is less then us.</span>	</div>	<ul class="l-1"id="r-444851"><li id="id-444908" class="comment">		<a name="444908">	<div class="comment">				<div class="commentHeader">		<h4>			<a href="/profiles/1264837" target="_blank" class="notranslate">Shariq Hashme</a>		</h4>		<ul class="actions">			<li class="notranslate score">0</li>		</ul>	</div>	<div class="flairWrap">			</div>	<div class="commentBody notranslate">		<span class="date">			Apr 11 2012:		</span>		<span class="commentText">That's all great and all..

I'm not asking questions like whether males are better suited to certain things than females, or the other way round. Respect is something else, I feel you completely misunderstood what I was trying to ask.<br /><br />I am asking about the essence of a person - we can all agree that, in retrospect, a person like Ghandi helped global society as a whole much more than the average commoner. Does this make a person worth more?<br /><br />Are we reducing ourselves to functional roles? i.e, a person is valuable if he/she fulfills their function well. Ghandi was a leader, and a good leader, he's worth more than a bad leader like Bashar al Assad. But we can't compare Ghandi to a shoemaker, because they fulfill different roles in society, and they could both be very good at what they're doing. Is this wrong? I believe it is, because it doesn't allow people to explore possibilities. Looking at people in retrospect this *might* work... Nah. It won't. <br /><br />Anyways, I'll let you reframe your answer if you so wish. I'm raising this question because judging people is so taboo in today's society for good reason; people like to pretend they don't do it. Perhaps it isn't that bad though, and would help us realize what it is we want from people in society, and what people want from their own lives.</span>	</div>	<ul class="l-2"id="r-444028"><li id="id-446882" class="comment">		<a name="446882">	<div class="comment">					<a href="/profiles/1146388" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.tedcdn.com/r/s3.amazonaws.com/ted.conferences.profiles/00/00/02/8e/7b/167547.jpg?w=50&h=50&op=%5E&c=50%2C50" alt="thumb" class="profile" /></a>				<div class="commentHeader">		<h4>			<a href="/profiles/1146388" target="_blank" class="notranslate">Obey No1kinobe</a>		</h4>		<ul class="actions">			<li class="notranslate score">0</li>		</ul>	</div>	<div class="flairWrap">			</div>	<div class="commentBody notranslate">		<span class="date">			Apr 15 2012:		</span>		<span class="commentText">I think you get my point about respect for human life versus capability.<br /><br />My trivial examples can be expanded to cover Gandhi. <br />He was just one person just as entitled to life, liberty, pursuit if happiness, a vote etc as any other.<br />But more capable of making a huge positive impact on society.<br />So perhaps you can say he made a more valuable contribution than most.<br /><br />The taboo you raise is interesting. I note we all make initial assumptions based on appearance, age, race. clothes, speaking - later on by behaviour and results. Stereotypes and intuition have a place in evolution, and perhaps in modernlife, but we need to keep them in check in most situations until we get more objective facts. <br /><br />However, the reality is people who are disliked although performance is good in terms of business outcomes will struggle more. We are tribal, we may struggle with diversity etc. But that is no excuse for challenging these paradigms. Whether black, white, male female, young or old, we should try come back to the individuals fitness for the task/role.<br /><br />There is just a balance in there to be found in each situation.</span>	</div>	</li></ul></li></ul></li><li id="id-447717" class="comment">			</li><li id="id-447597" class="comment">			</li><li id="id-446831" class="comment">			</li><li id="id-445858" class="comment">		<a name="445858">	<div class="comment">				<div class="commentHeader">		<h4>			<a href="/profiles/1240010" target="_blank" class="notranslate">arthur mitsias</a>		</h4>		<ul class="actions">			<li class="notranslate score">0</li>		</ul>	</div>	<div class="flairWrap">			</div>	<div class="commentBody notranslate">		<span class="date">			Apr 13 2012:		</span>		<span class="commentText">we look for leaders who can show us how he or she  can either help us avoid or survive a difficult  situation how we chose that person is either their  past performance or as is the case most times they sell us on the idea that they have the answer and as is the case most times we are making this decision when things are critical  human nature almost always seems to realize or starts to see what is happening too late then we start to look for a savior so instead of using logic we use fear and call it logical and sometimes we make the right choice and we pat ourselves on the back and call ourselves smart but if we make the wrong choice we bemoan our fate and blame the one we chose for not doing the right thing human nature so even though your question has merit it can not have merit when confronted by human nature</span>	</div>	<ul class="l-1"id="r-445858"><li id="id-446302" class="comment">		<a name="446302">	<div class="comment">				<div class="commentHeader">		<h4>			<a href="/profiles/1109730" target="_blank" class="notranslate">W T</a>		</h4>		<ul class="actions">			<li class="notranslate score">0</li>		</ul>	</div>	<div class="flairWrap">			</div>	<div class="commentBody notranslate">		<span class="date">			Apr 14 2012:		</span>		<span class="commentText">Mr. Mitsias....thoroughly enjoyed reading your comment, thank you.</span>	</div>	</li></ul></li><li id="id-444154" class="comment">		<a name="444154">	<div class="comment">					<a href="/profiles/1222602" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.tedcdn.com/r/s3.amazonaws.com/ted.conferences.profiles/00/00/02/4b/87/150407.jpg?w=50&h=50&op=%5E&c=50%2C50" alt="thumb" class="profile" /></a>				<div class="commentHeader">		<h4>			<a href="/profiles/1222602" target="_blank" class="notranslate">R H</a>		</h4>		<ul class="actions">			<li class="notranslate score">0</li>		</ul>	</div>	<div class="flairWrap">			</div>	<div class="commentBody notranslate">		<span class="date">			Apr 10 2012:		</span>		<span class="commentText">We 'measure' the value of people every day.

We start to believe that we can ask such a question as: 'Are certain people more valuable than others?'. We do this, in my opinion, because we have to 'run' things. Society has to function. So we catagorize and make comparisons between each other so we can function at our highest capability.

This subject is tough for me. On one hand, we have to live day to day, decide how and with whom we spend our time and effort. On the other hand, we have to see people for who they really are, beneath the publicly acceptable persona - and many are just not talented at it! So we 'write some off' because of what they've displayed, or we accept someone because of what they've displayed but come to find out later something different. Maybe this is a side-bar of Dr. ML King's 'content of character' theme. This then 'circles back' to your theme of how to 'value' people. But I have a very (too) extreme distaste of exclusivity. It seems easier to say that someone's not included than to deal with their different views as part of the group.

It's just something I'd like people to ponder about more - by saying we're all "the same", we're suggesting no one is better than us. I'll develop this point further in a reply above this.<br /><br />And in reply to your reply - yes, you are completely correct, and I completely agree with you. I am a very valuable person and all. Lol JK. As in, our value often is derived from how others perceive us. This is definitely how society is run in today's world - but perhaps there is more to being valuable than being valuable to others? Considering one's self valuable? Self esteem? What about that?<br /><br />I hope you too have a great day/evening Mary. :)</span>	</div>	</li></ul></li><li id="id-444935" class="comment">		<a name="444935">	<div class="comment">				<div class="commentHeader">		<h4>			<a href="/profiles/1109730" target="_blank" class="notranslate">W T</a>		</h4>		<ul class="actions">			<li class="notranslate score">0</li>		</ul>	</div>	<div class="flairWrap">			</div>	<div class="commentBody notranslate">		<span class="date">			Apr 12 2012:		</span>		<span class="commentText">OK.....I bowed out a few minutes ago....but here you ask questions I will answer.<br /><br />Self-esteem most definitely helps an individual transmit a sense of self-worth...as a quote I love says:  "If you place little value on yourself, rest assure noone will raise the price".<br /><br />I think that we have no control of how others perceive us.  Just the other day I overheard a mom tell her daughter: "why don't you color your hair, you have too much grey, you need to like nice".  The daughter replied: "you will love me more without grey hair?.....I love my grey hair, it's a shame you will not accept me the way I am".<br /><br />People, envious, ignorant people will have us believe we have no value, because we don't live up to THEIR standards......it is a way of controlling others. <br /><br />But we all have valuable things to offer any government or corporation.  From the men and women who clean toilets, to the paper pushers....well now I guess it's button pushers and mouse clickers.<br /><br />I guess, for me, knowing God values me, makes me value myself. I don't consider anyone more valuable than me....really, I don't. I think we all have different gifts, and use them different ways.<br /><br /><br />I will close with a story (a true one)<br />A lady once had a job at a hotel cleaning rooms.  She did such a great job, that after a few weeks the supervisor wanted to promote her to an office clerk. She declined and said, "many other individuals have been working here longer than me and deserve that promotion. In my opinion, I do the most important job at this hotel. I make beds and keep rooms tidy and clean. When a guest arrives, he doesn't care how orderly the office is, he wants to relax in a comfy room."  In that lady's opinion, the most valuable job was hers...humble, but nevertheless valuable.<br /><br />I'm not at all sure I have addressed your questions the way you have wanted, I hope I have shed some light, even if dim, into your topic.<br /><br />Be Well Shariq</span>	</div>	</li></ul></li></ul></li><li id="id-443888" class="comment">		<a name="443888">	<div class="comment">					<a href="/profiles/1265573" target="_blank"><img src="http://img.tedcdn.com/r/s3.amazonaws.com/ted.conferences.profiles/00/00/02/5b/ab/154539.jpg?w=50&h=50&op=%5E&c=50%2C50" alt="thumb" class="profile" /></a>				<div class="commentHeader">		<h4>			<a href="/profiles/1265573" target="_blank" class="notranslate">Mary Navarro</a>		</h4>		<ul class="actions">			<li class="notranslate score">0</li>		</ul>	</div>	<div class="flairWrap">			</div>	<div class="commentBody notranslate">		<span class="date">			Apr 10 2012:		</span>		<span class="commentText">Well, this is a very intricate question with a very broad variety of aspects to take into consideration. In my personal opinion, you can measure the value of an individual based in the impact of his actions in society. In fact, we do this all the time, people with great impact (at any level -politicians, artists, entrepreneurs, religious), are admired, protected and followed in our society.  This meaning that rest of us consciously or unconsciously price them over rest of common people, and this is because of the amount of people their actions can reach. So, the value of a person (speaking not only in the material sense, but also spiritually) can be measured; if in any given circumstance, society should decide who to protect or who to keep alive between someone who's actions impact many people or someone who's actions impact a small amount, the first one would be the only viable choice due to collectivism. The good thing is that we all have the potential to become valuable and therefore a viable choice to society.</span>	</div>	<ul class="l-1"id="r-443888"><li id="id-444033" class="comment">		<a name="444033">	<div class="comment">				<div class="commentHeader">		<h4>			<a href="/profiles/1264837" target="_blank" class="notranslate">Shariq Hashme</a>		</h4>		<ul class="actions">			<li class="notranslate score">0</li>		</ul>	</div>	<div class="flairWrap">			</div>	<div class="commentBody notranslate">		<span class="date">			Apr 10 2012:		</span>		<span class="commentText">Yes, it's not something that can be answered in one go. I raised this question thinking perhaps someone may have something very good to add to my chain of thought; something I'm missing. I think this is the only answer that actually understands what I was trying to ask.<br /><br />I'll try asking the question again:<br />People in recent times have come to the conclusion that racism, sexism, or any form of judging people based on a characteristic not chosen by the people being judged is COMPLETELY WRONG.<br />Everyone's happy.<br />A few years later, we start to get confused. Society is scared to acknowledge that it is judging people (for very valid reasons) - but it is judging people (not by race/gender/class, but by, for example, testing their "scholastic aptitude" via the SAT and judging their scholastic aptitude by this) - and that's why society is confused. <br />It is considered plain wrong to judge people - and even though society does it all the time, we don't like to discuss how we do it. There is nothing wrong with judging people - if I see a teen swear at his parents, and another teen treat their parents with respect, I *will* judge the former as being less valuable to society than the latter. I am not going to spend a month stalking both of the teenagers to make sure my judgement was justified, and I am not going to completely ignore what happened because I'm scared of judging the two teens.  If I spend a month stalking both of the teenagers, I'll spend a whole lot of my time worrying about things that don't concern me. If I completely ignore what just happened; I lose part of my humanity - I lose empathy.<br />Empathy is more than feeling pity - empathy is also to dislike a person who is doing something you consider hurtful to society - but not an ironclad hate, that never goes away, and not a hidden hate that nobody ever knows about. Rather, an empathetic person would walk up to a member of society doing something the empathetic person does not agree with, and advise said member.</span>	</div>	</li><li id="id-444035" class="comment">		<a name="444035">	<div class="comment">				<div class="commentHeader">		<h4>			<a href="/profiles/1264837" target="_blank" class="notranslate">Shariq Hashme</a>		</h4>		<ul class="actions">			<li class="notranslate score pos">+1</li>		</ul>	</div>	<div class="flairWrap">			</div>	<div class="commentBody notranslate">		<span class="date">			Apr 10 2012:		</span>		<span class="commentText">^ I hope whoever reads that gains some insight from it, because I don't really have a conclusion or answer to the question, and most of that is just musing >_</span>	</div>	<ul class="l-2"id="r-444035"><li id="id-444159" class="comment">		<a name="444159">	<div class="comment">				<div class="commentHeader">		<h4>			<a href="/profiles/1109730" target="_blank" class="notranslate">W T</a>		</h4>		<ul class="actions">			<li class="notranslate score">0</li>		</ul>	</div>	<div class="flairWrap">			</div>	<div class="commentBody notranslate">		<span class="date">			Apr 10 2012:		</span>		<span class="commentText">I really liked reading through your muses......I think that perhaps your using the word valuable might not be good vocabulary Shariq.<br /><br />Look, a long time ago, I read an interview from an author.  She had hosted a dinner party for friends. During the dinner party, someone said a racist joke.  Immediately, she told the person to leave her home.<br /><br />She then said in the interview...."when people show you who they are, believe them".  <br /><br />In my opinion, it isn't that the person is not valuable......the author "chose" to not be around a racist person. To another racist person, the remark would have elicited a laugh.....but to a person who views everyone alike, the remark showed a lack of love and so she made the person leave.<br /><br />I think that we know what we stand for, and then choose to be around people with the same morale, goals, lifestyles as us.  Not because they are more or less valuable, but because they make us more comfortable.<br /><br />And, of course, members of society who want to cause harm to others have to be dealt with. <br /><br />And, I don't lose empathy. I feel saddened when someone chooses to act in a way that has serious repercussions......my desire is for people to notice their bad ways.......but unfortunately, or perhaps fortunately, we have free will.  So, I can only be responsible for MY actions, and words.
