Other words			 such as colour, favour, optimise, prioritise, etc., tend to follow the UK			 English spelling, because I am English. Feel free to spell-check and amend			 these notes according to your preferences if you use them for your own			 situation, which for teaching and study is perfectly okay. </P> 		  <P>&nbsp;</P> 		  <H2><A NAME="introduction-and-context">introduction and			 context</A></H2> 		  <P>As with this website as a whole, this training guide is oriented			 chiefly around what's good for people, rather than chiefly what's profitable			 for organizations.</P> 		  <P>The reason for this is that in terms of learning, training and			 development, what's good for people is good for the organizations in which they			 work. What's good for people's development is good for organizational			 performance, quality, customer satisfaction, effective management and control,			 and therefore profits too.</P> 		  <P>This is central to a fairly balanced			 <A HREF="psychological-contracts-theory.htm">Psychological Contract</A> in			 employment organizations.</P> 		  <P>Profit is an <B>outcome</B> of managing and developing people well.			 People and their development enable profit. Enable people and you enable			 profit. </P> 		  <P>Organizations which approach training and development from this			 standpoint inevitably foster people who perform well and progress, and,			 importantly, stay around for long enough to become great at what they do, and			 to help others become so. </P> 		  <P>Training is a very commonly used word, so it features heavily on			 this page, but <B>learning</B> is in many ways a better way to think of the			 subject, because learning 'belongs' to the learner, whereas training			 traditionally 'belongs' to the trainer or the organization.</P> 		  <P>This is a significant difference in attitude, explained in more			 detail on the <A HREF="training.htm">training or learning?</A> page.</P> 		  <P>Training should be about <B>whole person development</B> - not just			 transferring skills, the traditional interpretation of training at work.</P> 		  <P>Whatever your role and responsibility, you might not immediately be			 able to put great new emphasis on 'whole person development'. </P> 		  <P>Being realistic, corporate attitudes and expectations about what			 'training' is and does cannot be changed overnight, and most organisations			 still see 'training' as being limited to work skills, classrooms and powerpoint			 presentations. However, when you start to imagine and think and talk about			 progressive attitudes to developing people - beyond traditional skills training			 - for example:</P> 		  <UL> 			 <LI>'enabling learning' </LI> 			 <LI> 'facilitating meaningful personal development'</LI> 			 <LI>'helping people to identify and achieve their own personal				potential' </LI> 		  </UL> 		  <P>then you will surely begin to help the organisation (and CEO) to see			 and accept these newer ideas about what types of 'learning and development'			 really work best and produces class-leading organizations.</P> 		  <P>&nbsp;</P> 		  <P>N.B. The UK (consistent with Europe) Employment Equality (Age)			 Regulations 2006, effective from 1st October 2006, make it unlawful to			 discriminate against anyone on the grounds of age. This has several			 implications for training, documents used, and the training of trainers and			 facilitators. For further guidance about the effects of Age Equality and			 Discrimination in training and developing people, (and in other aspects of			 managing people), see the <A HREF="ageism_diversity_discrimination.htm">Age			 Diversity</A> information, which quite naturally relates to the subject of			 'whole-person' development, given its connections with diversity and taking			 proper care of people. </P> 		  <P>&nbsp;</P> 		  <P>There are very many materials on this website with particular			 relevance to the design and delivery and management of learning and			 development.

Skills and knowledge, and the processes available to people, are no great			 advantage. <B>What makes people effective and valuable to any organization is			 their attitude.</B> </P> 		  <P>Attitude includes qualities that require different training and			 learning methods. Attitude stems from a person's mind-set, belief system,			 emotional maturity, self-confidence, and experience. These are the greatest			 training and development challenges faced, and there are better ways of			 achieving this sort of change and development than putting people in a			 classroom, or indeed by delivering most sorts of conventional business or			 skills training, which people see as a chore.</P> 		  <P>This is why training and learning must extend far beyond			 conventional classroom training courses. Be creative, innovative, and			 open-minded, and you will discover learning in virtually every new experience,			 whether for yourself, your team, or your organization. If you want to make a			 difference, think about what really helps people to change.</P> 		  <P>Many of these methodologies are explained on this website. Explore			 them and enjoy them, and encourage others to do the same.</P> 		  <P>All supervisors and managers should enable and provide training and			 development for their people - training develops people, it improves			 performance, raises morale; training and developing people increases the health			 and effectiveness of the organization, and the productivity of the			 business.</P> 		  <P>The leader's ethics and behaviour set the standard for their			 people's, which determines how productively they use their skills and			 knowledge. Training is nothing without the motivation to apply it effectively.			 A strong capability to plan and manage skills training, the acquisition of			 knowledge, and the development of motivation and attitude, largely determines			 how well people perform in their jobs.</P> 		  <P>Training - and also <B>enabling learning and personal			 development</B> - is essential for the organisation. It helps improve quality,			 customer satisfaction, productivity, morale, management succession, business			 development and profitability. </P> 		  <P>As regards conventional work-related training planning, and training			 itself, these are step-by-step processes - see and download a			 <A HREF="trainingprocessdiagram.pdf">free training process diagram</A>. More			 free training tools are available for download at the			 <A HREF="freeonlineresources.htm">free training tools and resources page</A>.			 </P> 		  <P>See for example the			 <A HREF="freematerialsinexcel/trainingplannertemplate.xls"			  TARGET="_blank">training planner</A> and			 <A HREF="freematerialsinexcel/lessontrainingplannercalculator.xls"			  TARGET="_blank">training/lesson plan calculator tool</A>, which are templates			 for planning and organising the delivery of job skills training and processes,			 and transfer of knowledge and policy etc. See also the			 <A HREF="freematerialsinexcel/induction_training_checklist.xls"			  TARGET="_blank">training induction checklist and planner tool</A>.</P> 		  <P>Use these tools and processes to ensure that essential work-related			 skills, techniques, and knowledge are trained, but remember after this to			 concentrate most of your 'training' efforts and resources on <B>enabling and			 facilitating meaningful learning and personal development for people</B>. There			 is no reason to stop at work-related training. Go further to help people grow			 and develop as people.</P> 		  <P>Having said this, we do need to start with the essentials, for			 example induction training for new starters. Induction Training is especially			 important for new starters. Good induction training ensures new starters are			 retained, and then settled in quickly and happily to a productive role.			 Induction training is more than skills training. It's about the basics that			 seasoned employees all take for granted: what the shifts are; where the			 notice-board is; what's the routine for holidays, sickness; where's the			 canteen; what's the dress code; where the toilets are. New employees also need			 to understand the organisation's mission, goals and philosophy; personnel			 practices, health and safety rules, and of course the job they're required to			 do, with clear methods, timescales and expectations.</P> 		  <P>Managers must ensure induction training is properly planned - an			 induction training plan must be issued to each new employee, so they and			 everyone else involved can see what's happening and that everything is			 included. You must prepare and provide a suitable induction plan for each new			 starter. Here's a free <A HREF="inductiontrainingchecklist.htm">induction			 training checklist</A>.</P> 		  <P>These induction training principles are necessarily focused on the			 essential skills and knowledge for a new starter to settle in and to begin to			 do their job. However there is great advantage in beginning to address personal			 development needs, wishes, opportunities, particular strengths, abilities,			 talent, etc., during or very soon after the induction process. The sooner the			 better.</P> 		  <P>An organisation needs to assess its people's skills training needs -			 by a variety of methods - and then structure the way that the training and			 development is to be delivered, and managers and supervisors play a key role in			 helping this process.</P> 		  <P>People's personal strengths and capabilities - <B>and aims and			 desires and special talents (current and dormant)</B> - also need to be			 assessed, so as to understand, and help the person understand, that the			 opportunities for their development and achievement in the organisation are not			 limited by the job role, or the skill-set that the organisation inevitably			 defines for the person.</P> 		  <P>As early as possible, let people know that their job role does not			 define their potential as a person within or outside the organisation, and,			 subject to organisational policy, look to develop each person in a meaningful			 relevant way that they will enjoy and seek, as an individual, beyond the job			 role, and beyond work requirements. </P> 		  <P>If possible 'top-up' this sort of development through the provision			 of mentoring and facilitative coaching (drawing out - not putting in), which is			 very effective in producing excellent people. Mentoring and proper coaching			 should be used alongside formal structured training anyway, but this type of			 support can also greatly assist 'whole-person development', especially where			 the mentor or coach is seen as a role-model for the person's own particular			 aspirations.</P> 		  <P>It's important that as a manager you understand yourself well before			 you coach, or train or mentor others: </P> 		  <P>Are your own your own skills adequate? Do you need help or training			 in any important areas necessary to train, coach, mentor others? What is your			 own style? How do you you communicate? How do you approach tasks? What are your			 motives? These all affect the way you see and perform see the training,			 coaching or mentoring role, and the way that you see and relate to the person			 that your are coaching, or training, or mentoring. Your aim is to help the			 other person learn and develop - not to create another version of yourself.			 When you understand yourself, you understand how you will be perceived, how			 best to communicate, and how best to help others grow and learn and			 develop.</P> 		  <P>And it's vital you understand the other person's style and			 personality too - how they prefer to learn - do they like to read and absorb a			 lot of detail, do they prefer to be shown, to experience themselves by trial			 and error? Knowing the other person's preferred learning style helps you			 deliver the training in the most relevant and helpful way. It helps you design			 activities and tasks that the other person will be more be more comfortable			 doing, which ensures a better result, quicker. Various models and tests are			 available to help understand learning styles - look at the			 <A HREF="kolblearningstyles.htm">Kolb model</A>.

DIF Analysis is a sophisticated (and			 potentially very complex) method of assessing performance, prioritising			 training needs and planning training, based on three perspectives: Difficulty,			 Importance, and Frequency. The system looks at tasks and activities (or skills,			 competencies, whatever) rather than looking at development from a personal			 individual perspective. DIF Analysis can be used in different ways: for example			 as a flow diagram to consider each activity using a simple yes/no for each of			 the three factors in sequence of Difficulty (yes/no), Importance (yes/no) and			 Frequency (yes/no), which generates eight possible combinations. At a simple			 level, an activity that scores low on all three scales is obviously low			 priority; whereas an activity that scores high on all three scales is a high			 priority. Weighting (significance of each factor relative to the job			 purpose/aims) is required in order to optimise the usefulness and relevance of			 the system, especially if applied to a group or organization. Analysis can			 become extremely complex, so it is sensible to ensure that the level of			 analysis is appropriate for the situation before starting to build complex			 analysis systems. For such a potentially detailed system, DIF Analysis does not			 automatically take account of personal preferences and potential capabilities,			 and as such consideration to this aspect is wise where trainee commitment is			 influential upon development, which in most situations is the case. The			 <A HREF="performanceappraisals.htm#skills_assessments_TNA_tools">Skill-set and			 TNA tools</A> on this website could, given modest expertise in spreadsheets and			 logic, be adapted to manage DIF Analysis, although better dedicated DIF			 Analysis tools exist. If you have one to share <A HREF="contactus.htm">please			 send it</A>. </P> 		  <P>Other methods exist for prioritising training. Choose or develop a			 method which is appropriate for your situation. Resist the tendency to become			 overly detailed. Analysis and detail should always be a means to an end (to			 achieve effective training and development), not an end in themselves.</P> 		  <P>Ultimately the best way to prioritise training is can be simply to			 agree with the trainee what they are most keen to commit to. All the analysis			 and detail in the world will not guarantee trainee commitment, which is			 generally the most powerful force for effective training and development.</P> 		  <P>Task-based analysis is important for organizational development			 measurement and planning, but approaching training prioritisation from purely a			 task perspective ignores the vital personal factor.</P> 		  <P>&nbsp;</P> 		  <H2><A NAME="developing-people-versus-skills">developing people and			 capabilities</A></H2> 		  <P>Many organizations face the challenge of developing greater			 confidence, initiative, solutions-finding, and problem-solving capabilities			 among their people. Organisations need staff at all levels to be more			 self-sufficient, resourceful, creative and autonomous. This behaviour enables			 staff can operate at higher strategic level, which makes their organizations			 more productive and competitive. People's efforts produce bigger results. It's			 what all organizations strive to achieve. </P> 		  <P>However, while conventional skills training gives people new			 techniques and methods, it won't develop their maturity, belief, or courage,			 which is so essential for the development of managerial and strategic			 capabilities.</P> 		  <P>Again, focus on developing <B>the person</B>, not the skills. </P> 		  <P> Try to see things from the person's (your people's) point of view.			 Provide learning and experiences that they'd like for their own personal			 interest, development and fulfilment.

The approach builds on management			 by objectives (MBO's) principles, but is more participative, voluntary and			 inclusive. By comparison, MBO's are a 'one-way street'; isolated and			 individually separate, prescribed along a single-channel towards a task focus.			 Well-facilitated 'activity focused mentoring' is consensual, team-orientated,			 with a personal development and team building focus, across multiple			 organizational interfaces, particularly to and between			 management/subordinate/peer levels. Activity focused mentoring methods also			 help develop systems (not IT and processes, but overall systems: ie., how an			 organization works), organizations, management and communications, in an open,			 dynamic, organic, three-dimensional way. The activity-mentoring approach uses			 several integrated techniques which produce more reliable and relevant training			 and learning outputs, in terms of individual skills, attitudinal development,			 and direct job and organizational performance improvement. The approach is			 <B>facilitative rather than prescriptive</B>, and broadly features:</P> 		  <UL> 			 <LI>strategic assessment of organisational and department priorities				and 'high-yield' training needs</LI> 			 <LI> interpreted discussion with line-managers of training delegates				and strategic managers of the organisation</LI> 			 <LI> pre-training skills/behavioural needs-analysis - all training				delegates - and pre-training preparatory work </LI> 			 <LI>small groups - practical workshops - short sessions - highly				participative and situation/solution-based - focused on practical job issues,				individual personality/learning style and organisational priorities</LI> 			 <LI>individually agreed tasks and assignments - focused on practical				priorities and individual needs (<A HREF="acronyms.htm">SMART and WIIFM				factors</A>)</LI> 			 <LI>follow-up coaching and mentoring one-to-one support - giving high				accountability and reliable deliverables</LI> 			 <LI>ongoing feedback and review with line-managers and strategic				managers - coaching/task notes for line managers</LI> 		  </UL> 		  <P>The process works on several different levels: individual, team,			 task, organisational and strategic. Activity focused mentoring also gives			 strong outputs in skills, behaviour and job priority areas, as well as being			 strongly motivational and where necessary resolving conflict and attitudinal			 issues.</P> 		  <P>&nbsp;</P> 		  <P></P> 		  <H2>mentoring cost analysis and justification</H2> 		  <P>Mentoring can be provided in various ways and programmes take a			 variety of shapes. Mentoring can be external, where the mentoring is			 essentially provided by external people, or an internal activity, using mentors			 within the organisation. </P> 		  <P>Due to the relative newness of mentoring as a formal organised			 process, and because mentoring programmes are so varied, statistics as to			 general costs and returns across industry are not easy to find. Here however			 are general cost indicators for a program essentially delivered by internally			 appointed mentors.</P> 		  <P> The main elements of a mentoring programme that carry quantifiable			 cost would be: </P> 		  <UL> 			 <LI><B>Training of mentor(s) </B>- comfortably achievable for				&pound;1,000/head - it's not rocket science, but selection of suitable mentor				is absolutely critical - good natural mentors need little training; other				people who are not ready or able to help others can be beyond any amount of				training.</LI> 			 <LI><B>Mentor time away from normal activities</B> - needs to be a				minimum of an hour a month one-to-one or nothing can usefully be achieved, up				to at most a couple of hours a week one-to-one, which would be intensive almost				to the point of overloading the mentoree. That said, there may be occasions				when the one-to-one would necessarily involve a whole day out for the mentor,				for instance client or supplier visits. Say on average a day a month including				the associated administration work, particularly where the mentoring is				required to be formalised and recorded. </LI> 			 <LI><B>Overseeing the program, evaluating and monitoring activity,				progress and outputs</B> - depends on the size of the program, ie., number of				mentors an number of 'mentorees' - if the mentoring is limited to just a single				one-to-one relationship then it's largely self-managing - if it's a programme				involving several mentors an mentorees then estimate an hour per quarter (3				mths) per one-to-one mentoring relationship - probably the responsibility of an				HR or training manager. If this person with the overview/monitoring				responsibility needs external advice you'd need to add on two or three days				external training or consultancy costs. </LI> 			 <LI>(<B>Mentoree time away from normal activities</B> - effective				mentoring should ideally integrate with the mentoree's normal activities, and				enhance productivity, effectiveness, etc., so this is arguably a credit not a				debit.) </LI> 		  </UL> 		  <P>&nbsp;</P> 		  <H2><A NAME="mentoring methods principles techniques"><FONT			 COLOR="#FF0000">mentoring principles and techniques</FONT></A></H2> 		  <P>Rather than simply give the answers, the mentor's role should be to			 <B>help the 'mentoree' find the answers for him/herself</B>. While giving the			 answers is usually better than giving no help at all, helping the mentoree to			 find the answers for him/herself provides far more effective mentoring, because			 the process enables so much more for the mentoree in terms of <B>experience of			 learning</B>. Give someone the answers and they learn only the answers; instead			 mentors need to facilitate the experience of discovery and learning. The mentor			 should therefore focus mentoring effort and expectations (of the person being			 mentored especially, and the organisation) on helping and guiding the mentoree			 to find the answers and develop solutions of his/her own.</P> 		  <P>Accordingly, many of the principles of mentoring are common to those			 of proper coaching, which are particularly prominent within			 <A HREF="lifecoaching.htm">life coaching</A>.

Mentorees need simply to open their minds to the guidance and			 facilitative methods of the mentor. The mentor should not normally (unless in			 the case of emergency) provide the answers for the mentoree; instead a mentor			 should ask the right questions (facilitative, guiding, interpretive,			 non-judgemental) that guide the mentoree towards finding the answers for			 him/herself. </P> 		  <P>If a mentor tells a mentoree what to do, then the mentoree becomes			 like the mentor, which is not right nor sustainable, and does not help the			 mentoree to find his/her own true self.</P> 		  <P> <B>The mentor's role is to help the mentoree to find his/her own			 true self; to experience their own attempts, failures and successes, and by so			 doing, to develop his/her own natural strengths and potential.</B> </P> 		  <P>We can see parallels in the relationship between a parents and a			 child. If a parent imposes his or her ways, methods and thinking upon a child,			 the child becomes a clone of the parent, and in some cases then falsifies his			 or her own true self to please and replicate the model projected by the parent.			 The true self might never appear, or when it begins to, a crisis of confidence			 and purpose occurs as the person tries to find and liberate his or her true			 self.</P> 		  <P>When we mentor people, or when we raise children, we should try to			 <B>help them develop as individuals</B> according to their <B>natural			 selves</B>, and <B>their own wishes</B>, not ours.</P> 		  <P>&nbsp;</P> 		  <H2><A			 NAME="tips for establishing mentoring programme or services"><FONT			 COLOR="#FF0000">tips on establishing a mentoring service or			 programme</FONT></A></H2> 		  <P>There are very many ways to design a mentoring programme, whether			 within an organization, or as a service or help that you provide personally to			 others. </P> 		  <P>Here are some questions that you should ask yourself.

But what happens when the organisation is unable to offer a			 management promotion at the end of the training programme? This is a familiar			 pattern and challenge in many organisations. How can you encourage people into			 a management development programmes, with no assurance of a promotion into			 management at the end of it?</P> 		  <P>The problem lies in the mismatched expectations at the outset: the			 trainee hopes (which develops into an expectation) for promotion. The			 organisation cannot (quite rightly) guarantee that a management job will be			 offered. No wonder that it often ends in tears, and what should have been (and			 actually still is) a positive experience, namely the learning and experience			 achieved, turns into a crisis for HR to diffuse, because the trainee feels let			 down and disappointed.</P> 		  <P>Here's a different way to approach management development:</P> 		  <P>First, come back a few stages and consider the values, beliefs and			 real nature of the emotional, spiritual and personal development that these			 people (the management trainees) might need and respond to most. Then you'll			 find it easier to define an honest set of expectations on each side (the			 graduates and the employer). </P> 		  <P>If the 'training' is positioned as a possible step towards a			 management promotion, people will become focused on the wrong expectations and			 aims, and when, as most of them will do, people fail to achieve a promotion			 they will feel they have failed, and the experience turns sour. </P> 		  <P>Better to design the 'learning' as a 'significant personal			 development experience' in its own right, with absolutely no promise of a job			 or a promotion at the end of it. That way everyone's (employer and employees)			 expectations match openly and honestly, and people are all focused on enjoying			 and benefiting from the learning as the central aim, rather than continually			 hoping that the management job happens, or in the case of the employer and			 program manager, preparing to defend and appease folks at the end when there's			 no job.</P> 		  <P> Added to which, by defining and designing the programme as personal			 development, enrichment, experience, life-learning, etc (there are many highly			 appealing and worthy ways to specify and describe a programme like this) - and			 not being afraid of doing so - you will attract the right sort of people into			 it; ie., the more emotionally mature and positive ones, who want to do it for			 the learning and experience, rather than purely for the chance of a promotion			 into management. </P> 		  <P>The irony of course is that students who respond to a learning and			 personal enrichment opportunity per se, with no guarantees or allusions to			 management promotion, will be the best management candidates of all. </P> 		  <P></P> 		  <P>&nbsp;</P> 		  <P></P> 		  <H2><A NAME="training-effectiveness-factors">tips for assessing			 organizational training effectiveness</A></H2> 		  <P>Look at and understand the broad organizational context and business			 environment: the type, size, scale, spread, geography, logistics, etc., of the			 business or organization. This includes where and when people work (which			 influences how and when training can be delivered). Look also at the skills			 requirements for the people in the business in general terms as would influence			 training significance and dependence - factors which suggest high dependence on			 training are things like: fast-changing business (IT, business services,			 healthcare, etc), significant customer service activities, new and growing			 businesses, strong health and safety implications (chemicals, hazardous areas,			 transport, utilities). Note that all businesses have a high dependence on			 training, but in certain businesses training need is higher than others -			 change (in the business or the market) is the key factor which drives training			 need. </P> 		  <P>Assess and analyse how training and development is organized and the			 way that training is prioritised. Think about improvements to training			 organization and planning that would benefit the organisation. </P> 		  <P>Review the business strategy/positioning/mission/plans (and HR			 strategy if any exists) as these statements will help you to establish the			 central business aims. Training should all be traceable back to these business			 aims, however often it isn't - instead it's often arbitrary and isolated. </P> 		  <P>Assess how the training relates to the business aims, and how the			 effectiveness of the training in moving the business towards these aims is			 measured. Often training isn't measured at all - it needs to be. </P> 		  <P>Look at the details and overview of what training is planned for the			 people in the business. The training department or HR department should have			 this information. There should be a clear written training plan, including			 training aims, methods, relevance and outputs connected to the wider aims of			 the business. </P> 		  <P>Look also at how training relates to and is influenced by appraisals			 and career development; also recruitment, and general ongoing			 skills/behavioural assessment. There should be process links between these			 activities, particularly recruitment and appraisals, and training planning.			 Detailed training needs should be driven substantially by staff appraisals. (It			 goes without saying that there should be consistent processes and application			 of staff appraisals, and that these should use suitable job performance			 measures that are current and relevant to the operations and aims of the			 business.) </P> 		  <P>Look particularly at management training and development. The bigger			 the business, generally the bigger the dependence on management training and			 development. </P> 		  <P>Look at new starter induction training - it's critical and typically			 a common failing in situations where anything higher than a low percentage of			 new starters leave soon after joining. </P> 		  <P>Look for the relationships between training, qualifications, job			 grades and pay/reward levels - these activities and structures must be linked,			 and the connections should be visible to and understood by all staff.</P> 		  <P>Look especially at staff turnover (% per annum of total staff is the			 key indicator), exit interviews, customer satisfaction surveys, staff			 satisfaction surveys (if they exist) for other indicators as to staff			 development and motivational needs and thereby, training deficiencies.</P> 		  <P> Look for any market research or competitor analysis data which will			 indicate business shortcomings and weaknesses, which will imply staff training			 needs, obviously in areas of the most important areas of competitive weakness			 in relation to the business positioning and strategy.</P> 		  <P> Look to see if there is director training and development - many			 directors have never been trained for their roles, and often hide from and			 resist any effort to remedy these weaknesses. </P> 		  <P>Base training recommendations and changes on improving training			 effectiveness in terms of: </P> 		  <UL> 			 <LI>relevance to organizational aims </LI> 			 <LI>methods of staff assessment</LI> 			 <LI>training design/sourcing </LI> 			 <LI>training type, mix and suitability, given staff and business				circumstances (consider all training options available - there are very many				and some are relatively inexpensive, and provide other organizational benefits;				in-house, external training courses and seminars, workshops, coaching,				mentoring, job-swap, secondment, distance-learning, day-release,				accredited/qualification-linked, etc) </LI> 			 <LI>remedies for identified organizational and business performance				problem areas, eg., high staff turnover, general attrition or dissatisfaction				levels, customer complaints, morale, supplier retention and relationships,				wastage and shrinkage, legal and environmental compliance, recruitment				difficulties, management and director succession, and other key performance				indicators of the business (which should be stated in business planning				documents)</LI> 			 <LI>comparative costs of different types of training per head, per				staff type/level</LI> 			 <LI>measurement of training effectiveness, and especially feedback				from staff being trained: interview departmental heads and staff to see what				they think of training - how it's planned, delivered, measured, and how				effective it is 				<P>&nbsp;</P></LI> 		  </UL> 		  <H2>measuring and increasing training days or hours per person</H2> 		  <P>Measuring training hours per person as an average across the			 organization, typically per year, is often a useful training and development			 KPI (Key Performance Indicator) of the training function -			 <A HREF="acronyms.htm">more training acronyms here</A>. If you can't measure it			 you can't manage it, the saying goes. </P> 		  <P>The degree of difficulty in measuring training time per person			 depends on what you define as training: training time per person on training			 courses is relatively easy to measure, but on-the-job coaching, informal			 mentoring, personal reading and learning - these are less quantifiable - you'd			 normally need to get this data from the employees via a survey or other special			 report. </P> 		  <P>It is possible to manage 'training time per person' aims and data			 via annual appraisals, when training past and future could be quantified - this			 could be a relatively simple add-on to whatever appraisal system you are using			 currently, and could relatively easily be cascaded via managers. </P> 		  <P>Your previous year's total training course time - i.e.,			 'person-days' spent on training courses - divided by number of employees in the			 organization is an easy start point. This will give you the average training			 course time per employee, and if you have no other benchmarks is as good a			 start point as any. Then perhaps agree a sensible target uplift on this,			 assuming the training requirement is linked to organisational aims and personal			 development, rather than training for the sake of it just to increase the hours			 per person. You can make this calculation for a team, a job grade, a department			 or a whole organization.</P> 		  <P>You could also survey the managers as to their estimate of how much			 on-the-job-coaching they provided per person as an average during a week. This			 gives another benchmark, albeit it an estimate, for which you can target an			 uplift and then monitor via managers reporting back every month or quarter.			 Remind managers to include, and if possible to categorise all the different			 sorts of training and coaching that takes place, as they will tend to forget or			 ignore certain types, for example; job cover, training at meetings, taking on			 new tasks and responsibilities, delegated tasks, shadowing, etc. Training comes			 in various forms - if you are measuring it make sure you don't underestimate			 the level of activity.</P> 		  <P>&nbsp;</P> 		  <H2><A NAME="training-planning-factors">training planning			 factors</A></H2> 		  <P>These guidelines essentially deal with conventional work skills			 training and development.

This is even easier when you have a designer or creative agency at			 your disposal.</P> 		  <P>Not all raw resources are converted into learning and development			 aids:</P> 		  <P>Many raw resources find their way into reports, business plans,			 sales presentations, or into the systems of organisations and teams. Some raw			 resources find their way into best selling books. Other resources help to make			 the ethos and strategies of world-beating new corporations.</P> 		  <P>The expression was: 'Knowledge is Power'. </P> 		  <P>The truth is now: 'Resources are Empowering'</P> 		  <P>Start building your resources now.</P> 		  <P>&nbsp;</P> 		  <P><B>Q. What formats and types of media are best?</B> </P> 		  <P>A. Raw resources can be in any format and media. Convert them into a			 format useful for keeping and finding them if you can do so easily.</P> 		  <P>Finished resources need to be in a format and media type			 <B>appropriate and friendly for the audience or learners or users</B>.</P> 		  <P>The format and media of finished resources should also be			 <B>appropriate for your delivery or operating strategy</B>.</P> 		  <P>If resources are refined and developed they can become an offering			 or business in their own right. Many information-based websites began in this			 way.</P> 		  <P>The modern digital age provides wide-ranging possibilities for the			 production and offering of finished resources.</P> 		  <P>Mobile technology especially offers amazing potential for the			 delivery of finished resources. </P> 		  <P>Ultimately consider your audience/users' needs, and ensure your			 chosen media works well for your operating methods and strategy.</P> 		  <P>&nbsp;</P> 		  <P><B>Q. Where can you find resources?</B> </P> 		  <P>A. Resources can be found everywhere. </P> 		  <P>For example:</P> 		  <UL> 			 <LI>The web, especially websites offering reliable reference				materials and tools. </LI> 			 <LI>University websites are usually an excellent source of reliable				resources.</LI> 			 <LI>Libraries - although nowadays much under-used, libraries are				fantastic places for resources.</LI> 			 <LI>Bookshops and online booksellers, including used books, which can				be remarkably inexpensive.</LI> 			 <LI>Institutes and associations and societies. Every field or trade				has its own governing or representative organisation. These tend to be centres				of expertise and knowledge. Most have their own libraries too.</LI> 			 <LI>Work tools that you use or create - spreadsheets and templates				especially - can be very useful resources for the future. </LI> 			 <LI>Many resources come free and very easy, for example, ironically,				junk mail can be a useful source of good and bad examples of all sorts of				business and communications. </LI> 			 <LI>Training courses and classes of all sorts naturally contain many				resources that can be re-used, adapted and re-cycled.</LI> 			 <LI>Resources of a social/historical or amusing nature can be found				easily and cheaply at Sunday car-boot markets or jumble sales, or when you next				clear out an old attic or your childhood toybox. </LI> 			 <LI>Use your imagination. Training and teaching becomes immensely				more enjoyable when quirky (but still relevant) props and materials are				introduced into proceedings. </LI> 		  </UL> 		  <P>That last point illustrates the wide range of things which can be			 resources. Not all resources must be academic and business-like; many can be			 entertaining, fun and quirky.</P> 		  <P>Avoid habitually using only the web for resources. Only a fraction			 of the world's knowledge and information is on the world wide web. </P> 		  <P>Often the best and resources are found 'off the beaten track' so to			 speak, especially if you seek resources in a particularly specialised			 field.</P> 		  <P>Be creative, imaginative and original.</P> 		  <P>&nbsp;</P> 		  <P><B>Q. How can resources be developed?</B></P> 		  <P>A. Your personal resources - whether for yourself or for helping			 others - can be an extension of you and how you want to be, and what you seek			 to become.</P> 		  <P>So try to develop your resources so that they say something about			 you. Be selective. You obviously can't keep everything of potential use or			 you'd not have time to do anything else. </P> 		  <P>Devise a way of keeping resources which is manageable and			 searchable. Chucking everything into a big cardboard box is probably better			 than not collecting anything at all, but there are better ways of organising			 things in terms of space and finding what you need later. Devise a system that			 works for you.</P> 		  <P><B>Develop your resources like you would build a team or			 organisation around you, to help you achieve your aims and goals in life.</B>			 </P> 		  <P>Develop resources that will help you to go where you want.</P> 		  <P>Imagine to yourself: "If I were doing my ideal future job what sort			 of personal resources would I need?" </P> 		  <P>Build your resources to fit your aims. </P> 		  <P>Give yourself time. A world-beating (aim high) set of resources in			 any field takes a while to build.</P> 		  <P>So start now. </P> 		  <P>In a few months you could be better resourced than anyone you know			 personally in your field.</P> 		  <P>In a year or two you could be better resourced in your field than			 anyone else anywhere. This is achievable if you focus and truly put your mind			 to the task.</P> 		  <P>You can, as the saying goes, stand on the shoulders of giants.</P> 		  <P>&nbsp;</P> 		  <P><B><A NAME="resources_permissions_attributions">Q. What about			 permissions and attributions?</A></B> </P> 		  <P>A. Since copyright law is complex and cannot be covered in depth			 quickly and easily, here broadly are some simple guidelines for using resources			 in the context of learning and development:</P> 		  <P>If you wish to use any resource created by someone else you must			 consider whether you should seek permission for your particular usage.</P> 		  <P>Many resources, especially if extracted in part, are free to use for			 teaching and training and self-development, however if you publish or sell			 material ('intellectual property' - IP as commonly called) which belongs to			 somebody else, then this would normally require permission and perhaps			 licensing and payment.</P> 		  <P>In general, the more you exploit somebody else's IP, then quite			 understandably the more likely that the 'somebody' will require something in			 return.</P> 		  <P>Showing some trainees a newspaper cutting to illustrate a point on a			 training course would be highly unlikely to attract any issues copyright or			 permission. On the other hand, using a 5,000 word training guide written by			 someone else, in your own training manual, without suitable permission from the			 writer, is not a good thing to do and could create a potential liability for			 you. </P> 		  <P>If in doubt ask. And if you cannot ask then take some time to			 understand copyright law as it applies in your situation, (there are free			 guides to copyright law available on the web) and make your own judgement.</P> 		  <P>The use of material without proper permission and/or attribution			 undermines the credibility and integrity of the user, and can lead to more			 serious problems if an IP owner considers that their rights have been seriously			 breached. That said, permissions and attributions can generally be resolved if			 approached positively and sensibly.</P> 		  <P>Whatever, there are countless resources which attract no liability			 at all, so if you find a great resource but it contains challenging IP			 implications, then find something else to use instead.</P> 		  <P>&nbsp;</P> 		  <P><B>Q. What about accuracy - checking and researching - and			 'currency' (being up-to-date)? </B></P> 		  <P>A. Accuracy and reliability are very important aspects of			 teaching/training resources. </P> 		  <P>Check your facts. Do not rely on the web alone for crucial data. The			 web can be wrong - and if the web is wrong on one page, it can be wrong on			 other pages too, given the tendency for web-based information to be copied.</P>		  		  <P>Books can be wrong too of course, but good reference books are			 generally far more reliable than the web.</P> 		  <P>A useful approach to gathering information resources is to use the			 web for the bulk of the research, and then to check the crucial facts in a			 suitable reliable reference book.</P> 		  <P>Certain resources are time-sensitive - that is to say, they become			 obsolete or unhelpful or worse, if not updated.</P> 		  <P>Conversely, many other resources are timeless. It also depends on			 your usage.</P> 		  <P>A 1995 guide to using the internet would be useless as a modern			 guide to using the internet, but as a resource to illustrate how the internet			 changes, it would be quite useful. </P> 		  <P>The ease by which you can establish accuracy and maintain currency			 ('up-to-dateness') should be a big factor in your consideration of what sort of			 resources to collect.</P> 		  <P>The area in which you work has a bearing on these aspects:</P> 		  <P>Certain areas - like law, finance, safety, for example - are			 strongly sensitive to whether resources are current. Other disciplines - like			 motivation and coaching - are far less sensitive to whether resources are			 current, but are arguably more sensitive to whether resources are entertaining			 and unique.</P> 		  <P>Accuracy and reliability are important for all resources, unless the			 obsolete or inaccurate nature of the resource is the purpose of its use (for			 irony, example of 'how not to..', etc).</P> 		  <P>Currency (up-to-dateness) of resources is crucial for certain			 materials and tools, but not so for others.</P> 		  <P>Use your judgement. Be aware of the pitfalls, and avoid them by			 considering currency and accuracy when you gather and develop your			 resources.</P> 		  <P>&nbsp;</P> 		  <P><B>Q. What about building connections with experts?</B> </P> 		  <P>A. As suggested above, people are resources too.</P> 		  <P>Experts and good quality people of all sorts can help you build more			 and better resources. They can help you adapt and develop resources, and give			 vital feedback when you wish to expand your activities.</P> 		  <P>Experts and good quality people can also help you with using and			 implementing your activities and plans.</P> 		  <P>This item doesn't focus on the value of people networks and			 networking, because that's big different subject, nevertheless, the development			 of contacts is an important part of your own development, so try to do it.</P> 		  <P>Successfully building and maintaining good connections with experts			 and good quality people must be based on your giving them what they need in			 return, whatever that might be (different people want and need different things			 - provided its legal and ethical). So ask experts and good contacts what they			 want from you and what you can do to help them.</P> 		  <P>People who take only, and give nothing in return, never build and			 sustain good connections with anyone.</P> 		  <P>Consider that high-achieving expert people are not generally			 interested in money or material gain. They are more interested in growth and			 self-actualization motivators. See the theories of <A			 HREF="maslow.htm">Maslow</A>, <A HREF="herzberg.htm">Herzberg</A>, etc. </P> 		  <P>&nbsp;</P> 		  <P><B>In summary: </B></P> 		  <P>Building and maintaining good quality relevant resources will help			 you become independent and self-sufficient - in work and life.</P> 		  <P>This is because people who have great resources tend to be:</P> 		  <UL> 			 <LI>Well-developed individuals - knowledgeable, skilled, up-to-date -				with answers to other people's questions.</LI> 			 <LI>Capable of teaching, training, mentoring and leading others.</LI>			 			 <LI>Capable of enabling and assisting change in groups and				organisations - using clever tools and materials.</LI> 			 <LI>Able to convey to others the enjoyment and advantages of always				seeking and finding answers and solutions.</LI> 		  </UL> 		  <P>Resources help answer questions, which is one of the essential needs			 of life and work. </P> 		  <P>Resources - of one sort or another - are generally required for			 improvement in anything - whether a small improvement or realisation for a			 single individual, or the development and launch of the mightiest corporation.			 </P> 		  <P>If you build effective relevant resources, you naturally become more			 relevant and effective yourself.</P> 		  <P>&nbsp;</P> 		  <H2><A NAME="starting-training-business-tips">tips for starting your			 own new training business</A></H2> 		  <P> Here are some simple tips for starting your own new training			 business. </P> 		  <P>Much more detailed business start-up help is available on other			 pages, listed below. </P> 		  <P>These are just a few important tips especially for starting a new			 training businesses.</P> 		  <P>When choosing the type of training to offer think carefully about it			 and avoid making assumptions or being drawn into too many areas.</P> 		  <P>Starting your own training business is in some ways a simple			 transition from being employed as a trainer, coach, team leader, manager, etc.,			 however a big difference is now that you have to find the work before you can			 do it.</P> 		  <P>On this point, your previous employer can easily be a prime prospect			 for you. Even if you leave on less than perfect terms, a previous employer is a			 good opportunity for securing freelance training work, not least because when			 people leave an organization, there is usually a gap and a period of			 uncertainty regarding the leaver's previous responsibilities. Lots of employers			 fail to ask leavers if they can fill in for a while on a contract basis. Ask.			 In any event, especially if you were well-regarded know their systems, you'll			 be a safe choice for them if they need some help, so keep in touch and			 (assuming you are not immediately stacked out with work from other customers)			 let your previous employer know you are happy to fill gaps in provision after			 you've gone. </P> 		  <P>Expect to negotiate a (sometimes significantly) higher freelance			 day-rate compared with your previous employed wage. Organizations account for			 ad-hoc freelance training quite differently to employed staff costs. Many newly			 self-employed trainers offer themselves too cheaply. See the			 <A HREF="negotiation.htm">negotiation</A> page. If in doubt, see what they			 offer before you suggest a rate - you could be very pleasantly surprised,			 particularly if they are in a bit of a panic and need a 'safe pair of hands'			 quickly.</P> 		  <P>Aside from your previous employer(s), finding new training contracts			 or selling training courses entails marketing and advertising - in competition			 with others operating in the same market place. This could be a new and			 significant consideration for you. Marketing and selling training is different			 to designing and delivering training, and involves different issues.</P> 		  <P>You must now consider what you can <B>market and sell</B>			 successfully, as well as it being something that you can <B>design and			 deliver</B> successfully. This requires you to consider the market place, not			 just the quality of your training.</P> 		  <P>So when you choose what training to offer and especially how to			 package, describe and deliver it, ask yourself questions based on the following			 points, so that you develop training types, services, offerings and delivery			 which: </P> 		  <OL> 			 <LI>you can offer with very appealing uniqueness and passion </LI> 			 <LI>ideally have good and increasing demand </LI> 			 <LI>are not strongly served by competitors </LI> 			 <LI>are relevant to industries you are comfortable with, and </LI> 			 <LI>can be marketed in a very specific focused way, to				decision-makers that you can reach cost-effectively. </LI> 		  </OL> 		  <P>Whether a website and online marketing will feature strongly in your			 business approach or not, 'Google Trends', and Google's Adwords keywords			 tracker (to access it open an Adwords account), are two excellent tools for			 evaluating online search trends and relative volumes in training (and for			 anything that people look for), which greatly assists answering some of the			 questions above, especially understanding demands, trends and what people are			 looking for and how they describe it (all of which can be quite different to			 what you imagine). </P> 		  <P>From a vital personal perspective, also look at the			 <A			 HREF="freeteambuildingactivities.htm#passion_to_profit_exercise_template">'passion-to-profit'			 process/template</A> on this website because this helps consider how best to			 combine your greatest personal potential with a business proposition. You may			 choose not to use the process in detail, but consideration of its underlying			 meaning is fundamentally important towards building a sustainable thriving			 business in any area of product/service provision.</P> 		  <P>Choose a business name carefully. Many people successfully use their			 own name along with a generic word or a few words related to training,			 because:</P> 		  <UL> 			 <LI>this usually avoids any future problems with copyright				(especially the potentially disastrous and easily made mistake of breaching				someone else's rights or trademark)</LI> 			 <LI>and it says that you are the boss and have the confidence and				integrity to have your name as the business name.</LI> 		  </UL> 		  <P>If you choose a 'clever' or obscure business name, think very			 carefully about it because it will have risks (like this website name, which			 might have failed without the luxury of many years to become established),			 either or both in terms of copyright protection/breach, and/or			 misinterpretation or confusion. </P> 		  <P>Although copyright and trademark law is complex, broadly descriptive			 business names are less easy to protect, and also less likely to breach someone			 else's trademark. Non-descriptive business names need to be checked against			 existing use, especially registered names, which means that when secured they			 tend to be easier to protect. The			 <A HREF="http://www.ipo.gov.uk" TARGET="_blank">UK government intellectual			 property website</A> is a useful information and reseach resource. </P> 		  <P>Contrary to lots of advice you'll see from financial and legal folk,			 becoming freelance (self-employed in other words) is very easy in terms of			 legal and regulatory set-up. I refer to the UK. In some other nations it will			 be a little more difficult, in others even easier. In the UK you do not need a			 limited company. You do not need a VAT number. You simply need to inform your			 tax office, which actually is a good source of advice about starting up. </P> 		  <P>If you have plans of substantial scale then seek qualified legal and			 financial advice, but for many new training business start-ups a			 freelance/self-employed approach is perfectly adequate for the authorities and			 the market place, as well as being very quick and inexpensive for the			 freelancer. </P> 		  <P>Public liability insurance is advisable because without the			 protection of a limited company you have unlimited personal liability for any			 damages arising against you. Many customers and venues insist on trainers			 having public liability insurance anyway. It's not necessarily very expensive,			 and is different to professional liability insurance of the sort that lawyers			 and doctors and high-powered consultants typically need, when potential			 liabilities run to &pound;millions rather than a few &pound;thousands. That			 said, insurance is a personal matter for you to decide and resolve as you think			 reasonable. I merely offer general pointers.</P> 		  <P>When starting a new business, especially from a			 marketing/advertising viewpoint, it's usually more effective to focus on a			 small number of strong unique specialisms - or even just a single very powerful			 offering - than to offer a one-stop shop or wide catch-all range. A good			 specialist will usually beat a widely-spread generalist in any single area.</P>		  		  <P>Networking is a useful marketing method for new businesses - look at			 the processes for <A
