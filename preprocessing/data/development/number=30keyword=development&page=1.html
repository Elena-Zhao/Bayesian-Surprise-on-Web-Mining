As experienced  lodging developers with a proven track record of successful office conversions to hotels in Holland, we believe that the Aloft brand will provide for a competitive advantage within the well-established Amsterdam market area.  We are also keen on Four Points by Sheraton and are working with the Starwood team to identify the right projects in the most suitable locations.   The team at Starwood have been great partners working with us through all aspects of the development process. </span>				<span class="right_quotation_mark"></span>				<hr/>				<h3 class="name">THE VINCENT HOTEL GROUP</h3>				<h4 class="title">Bart van de Kamp</h4>			</div>						<div class="testimonial" style="display: none;">				<span class="left_quotation_mark"></span>				<span class="quote">As a well-established, pan European lodging operator it is important that we align ourselves with proven brands that can drive the most value in the various markets and segments that we compete within.  We have operated three Westin hotels within Germany for an extended period of time and believe that the core focus areas for the brand (sleep well, stay well, be well) are clear and complement our operating platform.  As we aggressively expand our portfolio of hotels we remain confident that Starwood&rsquo;s central marketing delivery platform and brand integrity will provide us with branding solutions across all segments.</span>				<span class="right_quotation_mark"></span>				<hr/>				<h3 class="name">EVENT HOTELS</h3>				<h4 class="title">Michael Bauer</h4>			</div>						<div class="testimonial" style="display: none;">				<span class="left_quotation_mark"></span>				<span class="quote">White Lodging&rsquo;s experience with the Westin brand has been nothing but positive as it remains one of our industry&rsquo;s most clearly defined and trusted brands.

Starwood hotels &amp; resorts was the best choice, as we shared the same commitment toward creating a unique experience for our guests through a collaborative approach. the Four Points at Puntacana village was so successful that a year later we decided to build the Westin Puntacana resort &amp; club, which opened last December. Starwood has provided us with professional support and guidelines, and our hotels have been strengthened by their reservation system and SPG&reg; loyalty program. our collaboration has been fruitful and fulfilled our expectations.</span>				<span class="right_quotation_mark"></span>				<hr/>				<h3 class="name">GRUPO PUNTACANA</h3>				<h4 class="title">Hayd&eacute;e Rainieri</h4>			</div>						<div class="testimonial" style="display: none;">				<span class="left_quotation_mark"></span>				<span class="quote">At Shashi, we pride ourselves on delivering high-quality guest experiences that resonate with today&rsquo;s tech-savvy and social guests.
