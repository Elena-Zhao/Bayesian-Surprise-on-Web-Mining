Career laddersare rapidly shrinking or disappearing as reorganizations lead to flatter structures.  There is anever-increasing need for us to keep learning to keep up with the rapid growth in knowledgeand the rate of change of our workplace environments.  And, involvement in one's owndevelopment fosters greater commitment to the process than other-directed activities.  <H3><STRONG>LEARNING IS NOW OUR RESPONSIBILITY</STRONG></H3><H4>Career development (CD) is now the primary responsibility of individuals in organizations.  Arecent <A HREF="http://alumni.caltech.edu/~rouda/AHRD.html"> survey of Human Resource Development Directors</A> (1) indicates that they considerCD to be their least important function. This correlates with recent trends of disappearingcorporate career paths and job security.  Just as the responsibility for employee retirementplanning is no longer a corporate function, the responsibility for learning and for thedevelopment of career paths has been downloaded to the individual employees.   <P>Personal learning project management is a new skill for most people, one for which theyhave not been adequately prepared. The good news is that this responsibility also bringsincreased control over one's learning and career development, and the opportunity for a morestimulating and motivating work life.   <P>The purpose of this article is to help you develop plans for individual career developmentfor yourself and for other employees in your organizations.  This process results in adocument that has been referred to by such terms as an individual development plan, alearning contract, MBO (management-by-objectives) for personal learning, a personal"curriculum" for learning, and a plan for personal career advancement.  The results may alsobe applied to the "development" section of most performance appraisal forms.  <H3><STRONG>EXAMPLES OF PERSONAL LEARNING PROJECT MANAGEMENT</STRONG></H3><H4>These methods have been used recently in a variety of university and industrial settings:   <UL><LI><EM>Industrial environments.</EM> At the Niagara Division of Consolidated Papers (2), employees   draft individual development plans, both individually and in consultation with the Training   Manager. This process occurs annually, much like a performance review.  The individual   development planning process is focused on personal development and career growth, and   is kept separate from other HR management functions such as reviews for salary,   promotion, and retention purposes.  <BR> Individual development plans can, and often should, include formal training programs,   but the focus is on the learning and the individual, not on the organization's curriculum   and courses.  If used correctly, a compilation of the learning needs from these individual   learning plans (coupled with studies of organizational needs) can lead to more efficient   planning of training efforts by the organization.  <LI><EM>University teaching and learning</EM>.  At leading universities that focus on quality learning,   education and training, learning contracts are often used in courses to shift the   responsibility for learning from the instructor to the students (3).  Individuals design,   develop and implement their own plans for learning in their courses, in a process similar   to the use of the industrial individual development plans previously referred to. This   works especially well with adult learners who bring a variety of skills, knowledge and   experiences to their studies, and who also have a variety of needs for learning and   development because of the diversity of their working environments.  It also benefits more   traditional students who learn "how to learn", and who need project management skills   and experiences.   <LI><EM>Pulp and paper education. </EM>This process has been used very successfully in a senior course   in pulp and paper process operations at the University of Minnesota (4).  The students   felt that their learning was more interesting and exciting because they had the ability to   choose (actually, to propose and contract-for) their learning projects.  They also assigned   themselves more work, and therefore learned more, than with traditional methods of   instruction.  As a bonus, they developed their skills in engineering project management as   applied to projects of direct interest and importance to themselves.  <LI><EM>Industrial and corporate internships.</EM> This works especially well for individualized   learning experiences such as on-campus student research and development projects, and   for off-campus learning such as for corporate internships.</UL><H3><STRONG>STEPS TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT AN INDIVIDUAL DEVELOPMENT PLAN</STRONG></H3><H4>We use standard forms to help the learners follow a systematic process to prepare theirlearning contracts, individual development plans, or learning project management strategies.Here is what should be included in a personal learning plan:   <UL><LI><EM>Assessment. </EM>  First, identify your current skills, knowledge, abilities, and interests. A   previous article in this series (5) describes the <A HREF="http://alumni.caltech.edu/~rouda/T2_NA.html">needs assessment process</A>.<LI><EM>Goals.</EM>  Identify the new skills, knowledge, and experiences you would like to acquire and   have.  Do these goals match your personal and career interests?  Are your goals in   agreement with your organization's goals, mission and vision?<LI><EM>Learning purpose.</EM> Identify the gap between the current situation and the desired outcome.   This will produce a statement of purpose that should clarify why you want to learn   something, and what specific skills, knowledge and abilities you wish to develop.<LI><EM>Learning objective(s). </EM> Identify what skills, knowledge, and abilities are to be acquired or   enhanced.  Remember that this is only a plan, not a rigid promise; your plan can and   should be revised as your goals change and as learning occurs.</UL>For each objective, identify the following:<UL><LI><EM>Target date. </EM> Identify when you plan to complete the work for this part of your learning   plan.<LI><EM>Learning strategies. </EM> Describe how you plan to do it, and what process you plan to   follow to accomplish your objective. For example, strategies could include: reading and   study, interviews and discussions with appropriate people, mill trials, networking and   communication, reflecting on your own experiences, classroom study, literature review,   synthesizing and writing.<LI><EM>Learning resources.</EM> Identify what resources you plan to use to help you with this   learning process.  These resources might include, for example: literature, mentors, co-   workers, other professionals for networking, vendors or suppliers, classes, technical   conferences, professional association involvement, equipment manuals, laboratory trials,   production workers, teachers and instructors, field experience, your supervisors, and a   variety of learning technologies including computers, the Internet, and perhaps even your   mill's DCS (digital control system). <LI><EM>Outcomes and products.</EM> List the evidence you will develop to show the accomplishment   of your objectives.  What deliverables will you have produced by this process?  What   objects can be used to validate your learning experience?  This could include, for   example, a log or journal of your studies or observations, a literature review and   bibliography, written and oral reports, lists of questions, obtaining specific career   objectives, and more.<LI><EM>Evaluation plan.</EM> Describe the method you will use to validate your deliverables and to   evaluate the success of your learning project.  In other words, what criteria and means will   you use to determine if you were successful in reaching your learning goals?<LI><EM>Initial feedback and revision.</EM> Before starting to carry-out your individual development   plan, confer with your supervisor (instructor, mentor, or HRD-manager if available) for   feedback, for another view of your learning needs and strategies. This will help insure that   your learning will not only be based on your personal needs but will also be relevant to   your organization's goals, results, and profitability.  The more independent sources you   can use, the better -- seek additional feedback from your co-workers, colleagues, family   and friends.<LI><EM>Summary of results.</EM>  After completing the projects in your individual plan, you should   evaluate the success of these activities.  What insights have you gained? What new   understandings do you have? What new skills, abilities and knowledge have you acquired?    What experiences did you have, and what did you learn from them? How do you feel   about this process? <LI><EM>Next steps.</EM>  You should review the accomplishments and successes of this project with   your supervisor (and others, as appropriate).  Then update your learning plan for the next   cycle.  Remember that learning and growth are processes that may, and should, continue   indefinitely. </UL><P><BR><H3><STRONG>LITERATURE CITED</STRONG></H3><OL><LI><A HREF="http://alumni.caltech.edu/~rouda/AHRD.html">Johansen, K., Kusy, M., Jr., & Rouda, R., "The Business Focus of HRD Leaders: a picture of current practice", 1996 Academy of Human Resource Development Conference, Minneapolis, February 1996.</A><LI>Stout, D., "Performance Analysis for Training", Niagara Division of Consolidated Papers Inc., 1995.<LI>Kusy, M., Jr., Introduction to Human Resource Development -- class notes, University of St. Thomas, 1994.<LI>Rouda, R., "Pulp and Paper Process Operations:  class notes for learning contracts", University ofMinnesota, 1995 (unpublished work).<LI><A HREF="http://alumni.caltech.edu/~rouda/T2_NA.html">Rouda, R. & Kusy, M., Jr., "Needs assessment - the first step", Tappi Journal <STRONG>78 </STRONG>(6): 255 (1995).</A></OL><HR><BR><EM><A HREF="http://alumni.caltech.edu/~rouda/consulting.html">Bob Rouda</A> is a consultant on human resource development and process engineering, and is a researchassociate and student of organization development and change management at the <A HREF="http://www.stthomas.edu">University of St. Thomas</A>.
