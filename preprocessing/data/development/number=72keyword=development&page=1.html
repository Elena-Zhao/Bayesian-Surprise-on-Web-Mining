It offers			 useful alternative methods compared to coaching and mentoring too. Effective			 modern personal development now involves various integrated techniques,			 theories and behavioural concepts, that extend options around traditional			 ideas. This article provides examples of modern methods of developing people -			 enabling real personal growth and change - for individuals and organizations.			 </P> 		  <P>Optimising individual performance through progressive personal			 development significantly improves business performance too.</P> 		  <P>This example of an integrated approach to personal development is			 based on the work of UK-based psychotherapist Pam Weight, whose contribution of			 this free article is gratefully acknowledged. </P> 		  <P>Pam Weight's modern approach to personal and professional			 development is born out of the study of these contemporary models, which are			 explained in more detail later in this article: </P> 		  <UL> 			 <LI>Human development</LI> 			 <LI>Humanistic theories</LI> 			 <LI>Neuro-Linguistic Programming, and </LI> 			 <LI>Energy Psychology. </LI> 		  </UL> 		  <P>The personal development process enables individuals to achieve			 critical personal changes, specifically to:</P> 		  <UL> 			 <LI>update personal identity, attitude, values and beliefs</LI> 			 <LI>increase congruency and satisfaction, and</LI> 			 <LI>release blocks which have been restricting the realisation of				personal potential. </LI> 		  </UL> 		  <P>(In this context, 'congruency' means behaving and feeling naturally			 and comfortably - ie, true to oneself.)</P> 		  <P>&nbsp;</P> 		  <H2><FONT FACE="Tahoma" COLOR="#FF0000">modern personal development			 applications</FONT></H2> 		  <P> The integrated personal development approach is highly beneficial			 for most people. </P> 		  <P><B>It is however particularly effective for people who have			 experienced little or no benefit from conventional training, especially where			 progress is blocked by issues raised in the training process.</B> </P> 		  <P>Integrated personal development is also particularly helpful where			 one-to-one coaching or mentoring has had limited benefit, or has prompted			 surprising reactions. </P> 		  <P>Equally, those who want to develop themselves in some way, but			 cannot identify a particular direction, will also benefit from this sort of			 modern integrated personal development. </P> 		  <P>&nbsp;</P> 		  <H2><FONT FACE="Tahoma" COLOR="#FF0000">personal development			 essentials</FONT></H2> 		  <P> Modern personal development differs from conventional training			 methods, most importantly:</P> 		  <UL> 			 <LI>by settling the past </LI> 			 <LI>by reducing the effort required to live in the present </LI> 			 <LI>by formulating a compelling future </LI> 		  </UL> 		  <P>These fundamentals are rarely found in traditional skills training			 or coaching. The principles underpin the process of effective personal			 development. </P> 		  <P>&nbsp;</P> 		  <H2><FONT FACE="Tahoma" COLOR="#FF0000">modern personal development -			 an alternative to traditional training methods</FONT></H2> 		  <P>Modern personal development tends to achieve results because: </P> 		  <UL> 			 <LI> it creates balance in the system (the person as a whole)</LI> 			 <LI>it is realistic (and is perceived by the person as being				achievable and relevant)</LI> 			 <LI>it reduces stress, and </LI> 			 <LI>it increases personal control </LI> 		  </UL> 		  <P>These factors are not commonly present in traditional skills			 training or one-to-one coaching, and as such provide a useful alternative if			 traditional methods have not been effective.</P> 		  <P>&nbsp;</P> 		  <H2><FONT FACE="Tahoma" COLOR="#FF0000">personal development			 outcomes</FONT></H2> 		  <P>Many situations benefit from the improvements arising from effective			 personal development, for example: </P> 		  <UL> 			 <LI>within a corporate environment - producing better organizational				performance and effectiveness</LI> 			 <LI>to improve self-awareness</LI> 			 <LI>to improve personal communication with others</LI> 			 <LI>to improve personal relationships with others</LI> 			 <LI>reducing and resolving conflict and stress</LI> 		  </UL> 		  <P>Traditional training can of course produce good results in these			 areas, however, some people require more focus on <B>personal issues</B>, which			 can be difficult for some types of traditional training to address.</P> 		  <P>&nbsp;</P> 		  <H2>modern personal development - component theory examples </H2> 		  <H2><FONT FACE="Tahoma" COLOR="#FF0000">human development </FONT></H2> 		  <P>Human development includes the 'nature and nurture' elements that			 determine who we are and how we behave. Human development is a lifelong process			 beginning with 'nature'. Our 'nature' elements are everything we bring into			 this world: from our genetic make-up, our conception, up until our birth. After			 we are born, the 'nurture' process begins; namely every influence we encounter			 that affects us: our environmental influences and behavioural conditioning by			 others. We are each also subject to a slow continuous forming process; a			 sequence of stages through which we each pass in the same order, over a number			 of years. </P> 		  <P>Throughout these stages other developments occur: brain development;			 motor development; cognitive development; social development and development of			 self concept and basic trust. In addition, and importantly, our emotional			 development.</P> 		  <P>The influence of these human development factors on people, and			 their response to change, is considerable. </P> 		  <P>&nbsp;</P> 		  <H2><FONT FACE="Tahoma" COLOR="#FF0000">humanistic theories</FONT></H2>		  		  <P>Humanistic theories focus on our inner capacity for growth and			 self-fulfillment; with the emphasis on human potential. The early theorists			 referred to humans as being 'set up' or 'pre-programmed' for growth and			 fulfillment, unless thwarted by an environment that restricts growth. </P> 		  <P>From a humanistic perspective, a positive self-concept is the key to			 personal happiness and success in life. Moreover, <B>acceptance</B> and			 <B>empathy</B> help us to nurture positive feelings about ourselves, and that			 consequently we develop the capacity to extend and apply positive feelings to			 others. Overall, a humanistic perspective purports that people are basically			 good, and capable of self improvement. </P> 		  <P>(See also <A HREF="mcgregor.htm">McGregor's XY Theory</A>, which			 includes aspects of humanistic thinking, and usefully positions them in the			 context of corporate organizations, management, motivational development,			 etc.)</P> 		  <P>&nbsp;</P> 		  <H2><FONT FACE="Tahoma" COLOR="#FF0000">neuro-linguistic			 programming</FONT></H2> 		  <P>Neuro-Linguistic Programming is a model of human experience and			 communication. It has also been referred to as a study of subjective experience			 and human excellence. Importance is placed on rapport: mutual trust and			 responsiveness. Rapport can be applied to your relationship with yourself and			 your relationship with others. </P> 		  <P>NLP states that the greater the mental, physical and emotional			 rapport with yourself, the greater your health, well-being and inner peace. As			 a result, the greater your ability to relate to and influence others. Other			 pivotal aspects are:</P> 		  <UL> 			 <LI> knowing what you want - setting your goal or outcome</LI> 			 <LI>using your senses - being aware of what is happening to you helps				you regain the curiosity and acuity you had as a child - this increases				behavioural flexibility, which improves your chances of success (see				<A HREF="quotes.htm#cybernetics">the first law of cybernetics</A>). </LI> 		  </UL> 		  <P>See also the detailed free introductory guide to			 <A HREF="nlpneuro-linguisticprogramming.htm">Neuro-Linguistic			 Programming</A>.</P> 		  <P>&nbsp;</P> 		  <H2><FONT FACE="Tahoma" COLOR="#FF0000">energy psychology</FONT></H2> 		  <P>Energy Psychology is the collective term for a range of approaches			 focusing on the interconnectedness of mind and body. A principle of Energy			 Psychology is that psychological and physical problems can be treated through			 the body's meridian system and other bodily systems. Some of the approaches			 have their roots in traditional Chinese medicine energy healing, such as			 acupuncture. </P> 		  <P>From an Energy Psychology perspective; if the energy or meridian			 system balance is upset and left unchecked, there will be a physical			 manifestation. If there is a disturbance in the system, there will be			 impairment in thinking, and physical health. Clear the disturbance, and the			 body can do what it is meant to do - repair and/or heal itself, creating			 harmony and balance.</P> 		  <P>&nbsp;</P> 		  <P>&nbsp;</P> 		  <P>By carefully integrating and applying the behavioural models			 explained above, Pam Weight has developed a truly progressive and effective			 system of personal development. The approach is in tune with the needs of			 people living and working in the modern age, and provides a useful alternative			 to traditional training, coaching and mentoring practices. </P> 		  <P>Effective personal development must value the person's individual			 journey; acknowledge the person's learning from experiences; offer the			 opportunity for the person to update their system; and free the individual to			 consider their current capabilities and how and where to apply them. Truly			 effective personal development must be tailored for the individual, and be			 flexible and realistic, producing real and sustainable results, the basis of			 which must always be improved balance, less stress and more control.</P> 		  <H2>pam weight</H2>		  <P>Pam Weight is a psychotherapist with special interest in health and			 wellness, based in Nuneaton, Warwickshire. </P>		  <P>The contribution of this article by Pam Weight is gratefully			 acknowledged.</P> 		  <P>Pam Weight's website, including contact information and services			 details, is at: <A HREF="http://www.pamweight.com"			 TARGET="_blank">www.pamweight.com</A> </P> 		  <P></P> <BR> <HR> <BR> 		  <DIV CLASS="searchBox"> 			 <H3 CLASS="searchBoxH3">search businessballs website</H3><!-- Google CSE Search Box Begins  -->			 <FORM ACTION="http://www.businessballs.com/search-businessballs.htm"			 ID="cse-search-box"> 				<DIV>				  <INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="cx" VALUE="010837026464449256333:1okytpg5xok">				  <INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="cof" VALUE="FORID:11">				  <INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="ie" VALUE="UTF-8">				  <INPUT TYPE="text" NAME="q" SIZE="65">				  <INPUT TYPE="submit" NAME="sa" VALUE="Search"> </DIV> </FORM> <SCRIPT TYPE="text/javascript" SRC="http://www.google.com/coop/cse/brand?form=cse-search-box&lang=en"></SCRIPT><!-- Google CSE Search Box Ends -->			 <DIV CLASS="egSearch">e.g.				<A				HREF="http://www.businessballs.com/search-businessballs.htm?cx=010837026464449256333%3A1okytpg5xok&cof=FORID%3A11&ie=UTF-8&q=swot+analysis&sa=Search#1254">swot				analysis</A>,				<A				HREF="http://www.businessballs.com/search-businessballs.htm?cx=010837026464449256333%3A1okytpg5xok&cof=FORID%3A11&ie=UTF-8&q=change+management&sa=Search#1254">change				management</A>,				<A				HREF="http://www.businessballs.com/search-businessballs.htm?cx=010837026464449256333%3A1okytpg5xok&cof=FORID%3A11&ie=UTF-8&q=cv+template&sa=Search#1258">cv				template</A>,				<A				HREF="http://www.businessballs.com/search-businessballs.htm?cx=010837026464449256333%3A1okytpg5xok&cof=FORID%3A11&ie=UTF-8&q=team+building&sa=Search#1190">team				building</A>... </DIV> </DIV> 		  <H3 CLASS="browseCategoriesH3">browse categories</H3> 		  <TABLE CELLPADDING="0" CELLSPACING="0" BORDER="0"		  CLASS="browseCategoriesTable"> 			 <TR VALIGN="top"> 				<TD> 				  <UL> 					 <LI><A HREF="business-selling.htm">business/selling</A> 						<DIV CLASS="small">sales, marketing, strategy, business						  management</DIV></LI> 					 <LI><A						HREF="glossaries-terminology.htm">glossaries/terminology</A> 						<DIV CLASS="small">glossaries, dictionaries, acronyms, lists						  of terms</DIV></LI> 					 <LI><A HREF="human-resources.htm">human resources</A> 						<DIV CLASS="small">recruitment and selection, training, job						  interviews</DIV></LI> 					 <LI><A HREF="games-quizzes-puzzles.htm">teambuilding/games</A> 						<DIV CLASS="small">activities, games, icebreakers, quizzes,						  puzzles</DIV></LI> 					 <LI><A						HREF="lifestyle-environment.htm">lifestyle/environment</A> 						<DIV CLASS="small">climate change, sleeping aids,						  reiki</DIV></LI> 				  </UL> </TD> 				<TD> 				  <UL> 					 <LI><A HREF="amusement-stress-relief.htm">amusement/stress						relief</A> 						<DIV CLASS="small">funny and inspirational stories, quotes,						  humour</DIV></LI> 					 <LI><A HREF="personal-development.htm">personal development</A>												<DIV CLASS="small">personal development, self-discovery,						  self-help, life balance</DIV></LI> 					 <LI><A						HREF="leadership-management.htm">leadership/management</A> 						<DIV CLASS="small">delegation, motivation, change						  management</DIV></LI> 					 <LI><A						HREF="writing-communicating.htm">writing/communicating</A> 						<DIV CLASS="small">cv templates, reference letters,						  resignation letters</DIV></LI> 					 <LI><A HREF="diagrams.htm">diagrams and tools</A> 						<DIV CLASS="small">free templates, samples, resources, tests						  and quizzes</DIV></LI> 				  </UL> </TD> 			 </TR> 		  </TABLE> 		  <P></P><HR> 		  <P><FONT FACE="Tahoma" SIZE="-1" COLOR="#828286"> The use this material			 is free provided copyright (see below) is acknowledged and reference or link is			 made to the www.businessballs.com website.
