globalissues.org web site attempts to introduce the issue of development and sustainable development. Sustainable Development is often an over-used word, but goes to the heart of tackling a number of inter-related global issues such as poverty, inequality, hunger and environmental degradation.</p><p>In theory, development that is sustainable and not damaging to the planet is very possible. Of course though, in reality there are a lot of politics and challenges involved as highlighted throughout this site.</p><p>This section is woefully small to start off with, and hardly covers the issues in enough depth, though over time, I hope to add more articles to the ones below.</p><p>13 articles on “Sustainable Development” and 6 related issues:</p><h2 class="page-intro-title"><a href="/article/408/sustainable-development-introduction">Sustainable Development Introduction</a></h2><p class="page-intro-summary-info">Last updated Wednesday, November 18, 2009.</p><p><img src="http://cdn1.globalissues.org/i/env/earth-blue-marble.jpg" alt="" class="img-left" width="120" height="120" /> The idea of sustainable development grew from numerous environmental movements in earlier decades. Summits such as the Earth Summit in Rio, Brazil, 1992, were major international meetings to bring sustainable development to the mainstream.</p><p>However, the record on moving towards sustainability so far appears to have been quite poor. The concept of sustainability means many different things to different people, and a large part of humanity around the world still live without access to basic necessities.</p><p class="more">Read “<a href="/article/408/sustainable-development-introduction">Sustainable Development Introduction</a>” to learn more.</p><h2 class="page-intro-title"><a href="/article/787/addressing-biodiversity-loss">Addressing Biodiversity Loss</a></h2><p class="page-intro-summary-info">Last updated Wednesday, April 06, 2011.</p><p><img alt="" class="img-left shadow" src="http://cdn1.globalissues.org/i/env/ecology-planting.jpg" width="130" height="152" /> At the 1992 UN Conference on Environment and Development (the <q>Earth Summit</q>), the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) was born. 192 countries, plus the EU, are now Parties to that convention. In April 2002, the Parties to the Convention committed to significantly reduce the loss of biodiversity loss by 2010.</p><p>Perhaps predictably, that did not happen. Despite numerous successful conservations measures supporting biodiversity, the 2010 biodiversity target has not been met at the global level.

NGOs are non-profit organizations filling the gap where governments will not, or cannot function. In the past however, some NGOs from the wealthy nations have received a bad reputation in some developing nations because of things like arrogance, imposition of their views, being a foreign policy arm or tool of the original country and so on. Even in recent years some of these criticisms still hold. However, recently some new and old NGOs alike, have started to become more participatory and grassroots-oriented to help empower the people they are trying to help, to help themselves. This is in general a positive turn. Yet, the fact that there are so many NGOs popping up everywhere perhaps points to failures of international systems of politics, economics, markets, and basic rights.</p><p class="more">Read “<a href="/article/25/non-governmental-organizations-on-development-issues">Non-governmental Organizations on Development Issues</a>” to learn more.</p><h2 class="page-intro-title"><a href="/article/35/foreign-aid-development-assistance">Foreign Aid for Development Assistance</a></h2><p class="page-intro-summary-info">Last updated Sunday, September 28, 2014.</p><p>In 1970, the world’s rich countries agreed to give 0.7% of their gross national income as official international development aid, annually.</p><p>Since that time, billions have certainly been given each year, but rarely have the rich nations actually met their promised target.</p><p>For example, the US is often the largest donor in dollar terms, but ranks amongst the lowest in terms of meeting the stated 0.7% target.</p><p><a href="/article/35/foreign-aid-development-assistance" title="Global Issues: “Foreign Aid for Development Assistance”, Last updated: Sunday, September 28, 2014"><img class="figure" src="http://cdn1.globalissues.org/i/aid/2014/net-oda-2013.png" alt="Net ODA in dollars and percent of GNI" width="530" height="932" /></a></p><p>Furthermore, aid has often come with a price of its own for the developing nations.

In healthcare, the effects can often be seen vividly. For example, in many rich countries, up to one third of doctors may be from abroad, many from Sub-Sahara Africa, while many African countries have as little as 500 doctors serving their entire population. Reasons for this brain drain vary, ranging from poor conditions domestically to attractive opportunities and active enticement from abroad.</p><p class="more">Read “<a href="/article/599/brain-drain-of-workers-from-poor-to-rich-countries">Brain Drain of Workers from Poor to Rich Countries</a>” to learn more.</p><h2 class="page-intro-title"><a href="/article/559/united-nations-world-summit-2005">United Nations World Summit 2005</a></h2><p class="page-intro-summary-info">Last updated Sunday, September 18, 2005.</p><p>The UN World Summit for September 2005 is supposed to review progress since the Millennium Declaration, adopted by all Member States in 2000. However, the US has proposed enormous changes to an outcome document that is to be signed by all members. There are changes on almost all accounts, including striking any mention of the Millennium Development Goals, that aim for example, to halve poverty and world hunger by 2015. This has led to concerns that the outcome document will be weakened. Developing countries are also worried about stronger text on human rights and about giving the UN Security Council more powers.</p><p class="more">Read “<a href="/article/559/united-nations-world-summit-2005">United Nations World Summit 2005</a>” to learn more.</p><h2 class="page-intro-title"><a href="/article/366/world-summit-on-sustainable-development">World Summit on Sustainable Development</a></h2><p class="page-intro-summary-info">Last updated Saturday, September 07, 2002.</p><p>This section introduces some of the issues on the international summit (August 26 - September 4, 2002) where thousands of delegates met to discuss various issues comprising sustainable development.

Why is this? Is it enough to blame poor people for their own predicament? Have they been lazy, made poor decisions, and been solely responsible for their plight? What about their governments? Have they pursued policies that actually harm successful development? Such causes of poverty and inequality are no doubt real.
