It is often associated with pluralistic           politics and representative government, but it can also support democratization           by giving citizens, or their representatives, more influence in the           formulation and implementation of policies. Advocates of political decentralization           assume that decisions made with greater participation will be better           informed and more relevant to diverse interests in society than those           made only by national political authorities. The concept implies that           the selection of representatives from local electoral jurisdictions           allows citizens to know better their political representatives and allows           elected officials to know better the needs and desires of their constituents.           </font></p>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Political           decentralization often requires constitutional or statutory reforms,           the development of pluralistic political parties, the strengthening           of legislatures, creation of local political units, and the encouragement           of effective public interest groups.</font></p>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><a name="1"></a>Constitutional,           Legal and Regulatory Framework</b> </font></p>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Constitution,           laws and regulations codify the formal rules of the game by which a           decentralized system is supposed to function. Structurally, the desirable           architecture of these rules is quite straightforward: </font></p>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">the constitutions           should be used to enshrine the broad principles on which decentralization           is to operate, including the rights and responsibilities of all levels           of government; the description and role of key institutions at central           and local levels; and, the basis on which detailed rules may be established           or changed.</font></p>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">one or           more laws should define the specific parameters of the intergovernmental           fiscal system and the institutional details of the local government           structure, including, key structures, procedures (including elections),           accountabilities and remedies; and, </font></p>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">a series           of regulations associated with each law should interpret and describe           in detail the practices and measures by which the related law will operate.           Laws that deal with tasks that are shared between national and subnational           governments should include sections on intergovernmental relations.           <br>          Substantially greater detail and specificity is provided in moving down           this three platform architecture from the Constitution to Regulations.           Conversely, greater difficulty and a higher degree of authority (e.g.,           Minister, Parliament and Constitutional Assembly) is required to change           the provisions when moving up from Regulations to the Constitution.           </font></p>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These aspects           of degree of difficulty and locus of authority to effect changes are           important factors in determining where in the architecture particular           aspects of the decentralization system are defined and the relative           specificity of those definitions. The rigidities and flexibility established           in this structure have important implications for the management of           a decentralized system.</font></p>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The placement           of an item may be the result of a consensus, but often is the outcome           of sometimes difficult negotiations between competing interests. Those           concerned with macro stability, for example, may wish to have intergovernmental           fiscal rules be a matter for regulation under the Minister of Finance,           so as to give that ministry maximum flexibility in public expenditure           management. Local government advocates, in contrast, may argue (as they           did, successfully, in Brazil) for these fiscal distributional rules           to be enshrined in the Constitution. In Uganda, the purposes and mechanisms           for transfers are specified in the Constitution along with a formula           for determining the minimum size of the pool from which block grants           are to be distributed; the details of the distributional formulae are           the subject of regulations. </font></p>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As decentralization           is a complex social experiment a good case may be made for there to           be more flexibility in the ability to change the specificity of implementation           instruments, while enshrining the political and philosophical principles           in the Constitution and the operating structures in the laws. </font></p>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">In addition           to &quot;substantive&quot; law mentioned above, a country&#146;s &quot;procedural&quot;           laws can have profound impacts on the success of decentralization efforts.           For example, when local expenditures must be &quot;pre-audited&quot;           by a central authority, rigidities are introduced which make the benefits           of decentralization more difficult to achieve. When reviewing the legal           framework for decentralization, it is not sufficient to examine decentralization           specific laws -- other laws which mandate aspects of service delivery,           civil service, budgeting and so one must also be considered to ensure           a consistent approach.</font></p>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Treatment           of key issues in the legal and regulatory framework will be shaped by           whether the governmental system is unitary or federal. Under some federal           systems, for example, India and Canada, local governments are completely           under the authority of the State/Provincial level governments. The Federal           government is thereby limited in the relationships it may establish           with the local level and must seek to affect local behavior and outcomes           through the states/provinces. A decentralization policy such as India           is trying to establish is significantly complicated by this factor.           </font></p>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Some unitary           systems may exercise extremely centralized control over local governments.           In Indonesia, the Ministry of Home Affairs has had the authority to           appoint (and remove) mayors and even village heads. The structural impediments           in designing a decentralized system in this context are few, but that           does not mean that the process of instituting such a system is without           critical hurdles. Indonesia has had decentralization legislation on           its books since 1974; the process there remains far from completion.</font></p>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">As with           other key aspects of decentralization, the legal and regulatory framework           will be tailored to country circumstances. Nevertheless, there are a           set of issues this framework may be expected to address. Those of particular           interest to the work of the Bank include potentially, the classification           of local governments within the tiers established under the Constitution;           the broad organizational structures and their roles and responsibilities;           terms of office, operating powers, procedures and limitations of the           political leadership, distinct from the civil service; the degree of           autonomy of personnel policies and administration of local governments;           the taxing and fiscal administration authority of local governments;           the borrowing authority and capacities of local authorities; the budgeting,           expenditure management, accounting, auditing and reporting requirements;           service provision and delivery authority; and, the mechanisms for citizen           participation and voice. </font></p>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The legal           and regulatory framework should also be designed to recognize differences           in management capacity. Assignment of functional responsibilities &#150;           for example provincial capital, designated growth center, etc. often           implicitly recognizes varying capabilities of municipalities, but a           more dynamic framework which recognized &quot;capacity&quot; based on           performance over time would be more desirable in the long run. Matching           degree of autonomy and privileges to a set of performance indicators           &#150; which might include total expenditure, degree of self-sufficiency           (i.e., proportion of own revenues to total), budget management performance           (i.e., absence of deficits), and service delivery performance (i.e.,           client surveys) &#150; would allow the legal and regulatory framework           to adjust for changes in local capacity. The appropriate time period           for reassessments and indicators would need to be linked to country           circumstances as well as the specific details of the decentralization           framework. </font></p>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Among these           several issues, five warning flags (selected from a potentially long           list on the basis of downside risks) may deserve special attention.</font></p>      </div>      <ul>        <li>           <div align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="issues.htm#1" class="rightpara">Issue             1: Local governments at the same nominal level and their capacity</a></font></div>        </li>        <li>           <div align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">             <a href="issues.htm#4" class="rightpara">Issue 2: Local government             borrowing and the capacity to repay</a></font></div>        </li>        <li>           <div align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><a href="issues.htm#3" class="rightpara">Issue             3: Local government laws inclusive to decentralized functions</a></font></div>        </li>        <li>           <div align="left"><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">             <a href="issues.htm#4" class="rightpara">Issue 4: Voting democracy             versus citizen participation and voice </a></font></div>        </li>        <li>           <div align="left"><a href="issues.htm#5" class="rightpara">Issue 5:             Terms of office for local political leaders and the issues of authority             <br>            and accountability.</a></div>        </li>      </ul>      <div align="left">        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The disconnect           between the formal rules and actual practice regularly observed in many           countries is itself cautionary about the design and implementation of           legal and regulatory systems. Ambiguity and complexity create openings           for conflicting interpretation and resulting confusion. One agreed source           of interpretation is essential. Particular efforts to prepare and disseminate           popularized versions of the legal and regulatory system, as has been           done in Uganda, must be a key part of the decentralization strategy.           Complexity is often unavoidable especially at the level of instruments           for implementation, however, it helps if one instrument is not asked           to do too much. This facilitates communication and implementation of           the policy that the instrument is intended to support as well as monitoring           of the effectiveness of the instrument in that role. Adjustment to the           instrument and/or the policy also may be facilitated. </font></p>        <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">          <tr>             <td width="74" valign="top" align="left" height="19"><a href="#top"><img src="images/backtotopicon.gif" width="64" height="14" alt="Back to top" border="0"></a></td>            <td width="100%">               <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">                <tr bgcolor="#6699CC">                   <td align="left" valign="top"><img src="/images/spacer.gif" width="10" height="1"></td>                </tr>              </table>            </td>            <td width="12" align="right" valign="top"><a href="#top"><img src="images/toparrow.gif" width="12" height="14" border="0" alt="Top"></a></td>          </tr>        </table>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b><a name="2"></a>Participation           &amp; Decentralization </b></font></p>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Participation           and decentralization have a symbiotic relationship. On the one hand,           successful decentralization requires some degree of local participation.           Subnational governments&#146; proximity to their constituents will only           enable them to respond better to local needs and efficiently match public           spending to private needs if some sort of information flow between citizens           and the local governments exist. On the other hand, the process of decentralization           can itself enhance the opportunities for participation by placing more           power and resources at a closer, more familiar, more easily influenced           level of government. In environments with poor traditions of citizen           participation, decentralization can be an important first step in creating           regular, predictable opportunities for citizen-state interaction. </font></p>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The symbiotic           relationship between decentralization and participation leads to somewhat           contradictory policy guidelines. On one hand, mechanisms for citizen           participation could be considered a helpful pre-condition when evaluating           the prospects for successful decentralization. Accordingly, the design           of decentralization should take into account the opportunities and limitations           imposed by existing channels of local participation. On the other hand,           lack of participatory mechanisms could be considered a motivation for           decentralization and can help create local demand for more participatory           channels to voice local preferences. This note discusses each of these           dimensions -- participation as a means to successful decentralization           and as a goal of decentralization. </font></p>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The first           section concentrates on the broad mechanisms for citizen input that           are best seen as parameters of decentralization policy. These types           of institutional structures, embedded in the national political environment           and developed over a long period of time, cannot be altered quickly           by a simple regulation. The second part shifts to the smaller, more           specific avenues for citizen participation that can be created in the           process of decentralization. These incremental changes can eventually           evolve toward broader opportunities for citizen participation and democratic           governance. </font></p>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Section           1: Participation as a Pre-condition: Broad Decision-Making Influence</font></p>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Section           2: Participation as a Goal: The More Attainable Beginning Reforms</font></p>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><i>Conclusion</i></font></p>        <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Citizen           participation in some form is an essential part of successful decentralization.           It is becoming a more common element in developing country political           environments - 13,000 units of local government in Latin America are           now elected, compared to 3,000 in 1973 - but the flow of information           is by no means undistorted. Planning decentralization policies should           take these informational imperfections into account and attempt to improve           the depth and degree of citizen participation in local government action.           Local government responsiveness, one of the main rationales for decentralizing           can not be realized when there are no mechanisms for transferring information           between the local government and its constituents. </font></p>      </div>      <p></p>      <p></p>      <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">        <tr>           <td width="74" valign="top" align="left" height="19"><a href="#top"><img src="images/backtotopicon.gif" width="64" height="14" alt="Back to top" border="0"></a></td>          <td width="100%">             <table width="100%" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">              <tr bgcolor="#6699CC">                 <td align="left" valign="top"><img src="/images/spacer.gif" width="10" height="1"></td>              </tr>            </table>          </td>          <td width="12" align="right" valign="top"><a href="#top"><img src="images/toparrow.gif" width="12" height="14" border="0" alt="Top"></a></td>        </tr>      </table>    </td>  </tr></table>                <table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center">  <tr valign="top" align="left">     <td colspan="2" bgcolor="#000000"><img src="/images/spacer.gif" width="1" height="1"></td>  </tr></table><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center">  <tr valign="top" align="left">     </table><!-- FOOTER STARTS HERE --><table width="740" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" align="center" class="bottomlinks">  <tr>     <td width="32" valign="top" align="left" height="58" rowspan="2"><img src="images/globebottom.gif" width="33" height="29" alt="Globe logo"></td>    <td height="7" align="left" valign="bottom" width="708"><a href="http://www.worldbank.org/contacts/" class="bottomlinks"><b>Contact       Us</b></a><b><span class="rightpara">&nbsp;|&nbsp;</span><a href="http://www.worldbank.org/help/" class="bottomlinks">Help/FAQ&nbsp;</a><span class="rightpara">|&nbsp;</span><a href="http://lnweb18.worldbank.org/ext/language.nsf/1c5f3a985e71f084852567b100598550/c212a6e715a6e301852567b1006250c1?OpenDocument" class="bottomlinks">Site       Index&nbsp;</a><span class="rightpara">| </span><a href="http://www.worldbank.org/search.htm" class="bottomlinks">Search&nbsp;</a><span class="rightpara">|&nbsp;</span></b></td>  </tr>  <tr>     <td height="29" align="left" valign="top" width="708"><span class="bottomlinks">�       2001 The World Bank Group, All Rights Reserved.</span> <span class="terms"><a href="http://www.worldbank.org/html/extdr/terms.htm" class="terms">Terms       and Conditions</a></span><span class="bottomlinks">. <a href="http://www.worldbank.org/html/extdr/privacy.htm" class="terms">Privacy       Policy</a></span></td>  </tr></table><!-- FOOTER ENDS HERE --></body></html>
