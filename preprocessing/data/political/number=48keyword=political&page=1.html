All political analysts decided that this was anhonest statement but political folly as no-one was going to vote in a party -however laudable its policies - if they meant that their own income tax wouldincrease, even if they did support a policy of more money going into stateeducation.</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Any imposed &quot;Green Tax&quot; to fund a clean-up ofthe environment would also certainly meet with the same response. Everybodywants a cleaner environment but no individual wants to see his/her incomedecreased to assist in the financing of it. Only if the party analysts andresearchers have got their information correct, and their findings show thatpeople would be willing to do this, would there be a chance that this wouldbecome an electoral issue.</font></p><div align="center">  <center>  <table border="1" width="477" height="52">    <tr>      <td width="477" height="52" style="background-color: #FFFF99; border: 3 solid #FF0000"><b><font face="Arial" size="2">Therefore, do political parties merely respond to what thepublic want or do they drive forward their own agenda and try to bring thepublic on board?

A potential party leader shouldbe charismatic, good at public speaking, have the powers of persuasion, theenergy for public campaigning and above all the respect of his/her party.&nbsp;</font></p><p><font face="Arial"> Whilethe Liberal Democrats and Labour used the traditional method of votingfor a new leader&nbsp; - by a simple vote among MP�s - the Tories have for the2001 leadership contest introduced a vote for its 330,000 party members to givethe system a greater air of <a href="democracy.htm">democracy</a>.&nbsp;</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The system in the Labour Party israther more convoluted with the involvement of the unions and party members etc.The recent reforms leading to &quot;one person one vote&quot; changed thissystem but it does claim to be fairer as it includes all those who have a vestedinterest in the party and who have a right to vote on such matters rather thanleaving it to just a handful of MP�s representing the party in Parliament.</font></p><p><font face="Arial">At a local and regional level, parties also �introduce�selected candidates to politics. Local parties are vital in identifyingpotential talent within their ranks. All <a href="labour_cabinet_2001.htm"> Cabinet members</a> and Prime Ministers inrecent years had to start their political career at a local level and the inputof local parties is vital to the strength of the party at a national level. Inone sense, the local party is the breeding ground for potential party leaders.</font></p><p><font face="Arial">A party in power requires the support of the people itgoverns. Without this most basic requirement, a government will find it hard tofunction effectively. The Poll Tax rebellion under Margaret Thatcher showed whatcould happen when a government misreads public desires. The fuel crisis in 2000 also showed the power the public hasthough its impact at the 2001 election appeared to be minimal in terms ofsupport for the Labour Party. Through all of this, certain conventions areheld by all parties in Britain :</font></p>      <font face="Arial">If a party loses an election, it will confirm the      right of the victorious party to exercise power. It will not deny its      right to govern.</font>    <font face="Arial">Parliament remains at the centre of the political      system in Britain (though recognising the importance of the <a href="devolution.htm"> devolved</a>      bodies of <a href="scotland_and_devolution.htm">Scotland</a>, <a href="wales_and_devolution.htm"> Wales</a> and Northern Ireland) and MP�s generally work      to uphold its traditions and procedures.</font>    <font face="Arial">Parliament recognises the status of the monarch as      head of state.</font>    <font face="Arial">If the nation is threatened with a national crisis,      traditional political rivalry is suspended and all parties work together      in the interest of national unity.</font>  <p><font face="Arial">One of the roles played by parties in the political systemof Britain is that of organising political activities. Various institutions areunlikely to operate without this input from the parties.</font></p><p><font face="Arial">One of the key areas in which parties operate is that ofthe formulation of policy programmes. If a party is elected to power after ageneral election, it must have policies ready on the very same day that itofficially takes over the country. A failure to do so would be a failure togovern. In the run-up to an election, a party clearly states its <a href="2001_labour_party_manifesto.htm">manifesto</a>.Probably at no time in history are these manifestos so readily available withthe growth of the Internet.&nbsp;</font></p><p><font face="Arial"> Therefore, no-one in the Civil Service can claim tobe lacking in knowledge of potential government policies. A newlyelected government should have direction, shape and organisation almost from thestart of its time in office. Those who need to know about these policies will doso.&nbsp;</font></p><div align="center">  <center>  <table border="1" width="373" height="39">    <tr>      <td width="373" height="39" style="background-color: #CCFFFF; border: 3 groove #FF0066"><font face="Arial" size="2"><b> &quot;Without the policy-making functions of parties, there is likely to beincoherence, delay and contradiction in the political process.&quot; (McNaughton)</b></font></td>    </tr>  </table>  </center></div><p><font face="Arial">Parties also recruit candidates for elections. It wouldnot be feasible for a party leader to know about every potential candidate atconstituency level. This process of selection has to come from each constituencyparty office. It is their responsibility to the party to ensure that eachcandidate is able and has an appeal to the electorate of that constituency. Inthis sense, the future of the party as a whole is dependent on the constituencyhierarchy selecting people of ability who might rise up through the ranks of theparty if elected.</font></p><p><font face="Arial">At a local level, parties are of vital importance duringan election. Local party supporters are crucial in getting out and encouragingpeople to actually vote. It is these party faithful who deliver leaflets,organise local phone-ins, organise transport etc. Without these people in aparty, they would have little hope of electoral success especially in an erawhich seems to indicate that fewer and fewer people are voting in elections ofall sorts. The involvement of such people is vital for a party but it is also amajor part of ensuring that an election is run successfully and fairly - animportant component of a <a href="democracy.htm">democracy</a>.</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Parliamentary committees are also part of the partymachine. It is these committees that scrutinise potential government legislationor actions. These committees need able and broad minded members. The selectionprocess of parties for an election or potential candidates for Parliament isimplicit in this process and goes back to the role played by parties at a locallevel. In this sense, parties organise the business of Parliament.<br></font></p><b><div align="center">  <center>  <table border="1" width="312" height="34">    <tr>      <td width="312" height="34" style="background-color: #CCFF99; border: 3 outset #FF0000"><b><p ALIGN="CENTER"><font face="Arial" size="4">Political Parties and the Public</font></p></b>      </td>    </tr>  </table>  </center></div></b><p><font face="Arial">A cynic might conclude that parties are only interested inwhat is good for themselves. However, the role of a party at all levels is veryimportant in informing the public about the major issues of the day. The factthat arguments take place across the floor of the House of Commons gives thepublic access to the arguments and counter-arguments surrounding a major issue.That these debates are televised and recorded for posterity are implicit in a <a href="democracy.htm">democracy</a>.&nbsp;</font></p><p><font face="Arial"> Such a system would not be found in a <a href="party_systems.htm"> one-partystate</a>. Giving thepublic (and by implication the electorate) such a resource as information isvital in the political process as it gives the public the majority of argumentsabout whatever issue is being argued about; each party will present its pointsof view in an attempt to mobilise support and the public will then be at largeto make a judgement.&nbsp;</font></p><p><font face="Arial"> In a <a href="party_systems.htm"> one-party state</a>, the public would be presented withjust one point of view which may or may not be true and they would not beallowed to make a judgement on that issue. One way of holding a governmentaccountable in a <a href="democracy.htm"> democracy</a> is to hear and have access to the full range ofarguments and making a conclusion on these arguments. The party in power willpresent its arguments accordingly while the opposition parties will presenttheir arguments against government policies. In this way, the public at largeusually get the necessary information before making a valued judgement.</font></p><p><font face="Arial">After the <a href="1997_general_election.htm"> 1997election</a>, one party - Labour - dominatedParliament as a result of its parliamentary majority. This was sustained afterthe <a href="2001_british_general_election.htm">2001 election</a> result. Even if party mavericksare willing to �rock the party boat�, the party�s majority is such thatlack of support from the likes of Tony Benn, Dennis Skinner, Jeremy Corbin etc.is unimportant though possibly embarrassing for the government. With so manyyoung Labour MP�s out to make their mark with the party�s leadership, mostfollow the party line and party unity within the House remains.</font></p><p><font face="Arial">It would be unwise to state that the government can do asit pleases within the constitutional boundaries of Britain�s political set-upas it has to answer to the public at some stage in its life. However, the partydoes have its <a href="2001_labour_party_manifesto.htm">2001 manifesto</a> to deliver and in this sense the party isresponsible to the electorate if it is seen to be failing to deliver this. Themanifesto was a written document made publicly available in 2001. Therefore, thepublic have a right to expect that the issues raised on the <a href="2001_labour_party_manifesto.htm"> manifesto</a> are atleast addressed in some degree by the government.&nbsp;</font></p><p><font face="Arial"> In this sense, an <a href="2001_labour_party_manifesto.htm"> electionmanifesto</a> can become a political millstone. For example, the 1997 Labourmanifesto claimed it would reduce hospital waiting queues by a specificpercentage by the end of their time in government.&nbsp; Over the course of 4 years the climate in which a government operatescan change greatly. The state of the NHS is an Achilles Heel for anygovernment&nbsp; with the Blair government caught out by the 1999 flu epidemic which was quickly latched on toby opposition parties. Then, the Labour political spin was that the chaos thatensued in the NHS was the result of 18 years of Tory lack of finance etc. Now in2001, still tied to its promises in the 2002 manifesto, the government has been accused of 'fiddling' NHS waiting timefigures - ironically, something it accused the Major government of doing whileit was in opposition from 1992 to 1997</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The party in power also has what is referred to as a �doctor�smandate�. This is when a problem occurs while it is in power which it has torespond to as a doctor would respond to a patient�s illness. John Major wouldhave faced such a crisis with the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait; likewise, Tony Blairwith the Balkans crises. The public expectresolute action even if the situation that occurred was not referred to in amanifesto.</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Parliament is effectively controlled by the governmentespecially when the current government has such a large working majority. Thelegislation it wishes to introduce is controlled by party managers and itscommittees are staffed by party appointees. MP�s are expected to adhere to theparty line and their loyalty is effectively controlled by the <a href="labour_party_whip.htm"> partywhips</a>.&nbsp;</font></p><p><font face="Arial">During the course of a 5 year government, very few pieces of private memberslegislation gets to the floor and if it is contentious, it can be killed offthrough lack of time. Departmental select committees, which examine governmentconduct within that department, do allow MP�s more scope for manoeuvre butoutside of these select committees, those same MP�s will be looking forpromotion within the party, and therefore are unlikely to want to be seen byparty managers as mavericks who cannot be trusted. Therefore, the shadow of thegoverning party still tends to dominate MP�s of the governing party on theselect committees.</font></p><p><font face="Arial">The appointment of <a href="labour_cabinet_2001.htm"> Cabinetministers</a>, junior ministers,senior staff to committees etc allows the party leadership huge powers ofpatronage. This in itself allows for a great degree of loyalty as few MP�swish to remain on the backbench and a constituency selection panel may not beimpressed with a MP who seems to have done nothing to advance his/her careerwithin Parliament.</font></p><p><font face="Arial">Opposition to the government comes from the parties thatsit on the Opposition benches in Parliament. They have to remain tightlyorganised, disciplined and controlled if they are to maintain an effectiveopposition to the government in power.&nbsp;</font></p><p><font face="Arial"> If none of these exist, then thegovernment has what is effectively a free hand to pursue what it wishes towithout any effective opposition. During the fuel crisis of September 2000, theTory opposition scored many points off of the Labour government as a directresult of the government�s inability to end the blockade. The polls indicatedthat the gap between both parties had dramatically fallen to single figures forthe first time since 1997. Yet less than one month later and after the ToryParty Conference at Bournemouth, the figure was back up to 13% after the ToryParty�s problems on where it stood with the prosecution (or not) of thosefound with cannabis on them. One comment by the Opposition Home Secretary - AnneWiddecombe - was seized on by the media and left the then&nbsp; party leader, WilliamHague, in a situation he could not win; does he support one of his colleagues onthe Opposition front bench, or does he not? His comment that he would put outto the party all sides of the arguments to discuss before coming to a partydecision on the issue was probably the best he could do in the circumstances.&nbsp;</font></p><img src="clear.gif" width="1" height="10" border="0" class="spacer-gif" alt="" title="" /><br /><div id="subpagemenu" class="component" align="center" ><div id="subpageHeader" ></div></div><div class="citationBox" ><h4>MLA Citation/Reference</h4><p><i>"Political Parties".&nbsp;HistoryLearningSite.co.uk.&nbsp;2006.
