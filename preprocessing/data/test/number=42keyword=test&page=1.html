The TCP session makes use of Port 80 & Port 5050. The three stages of the test are Ping, Download, and Upload.</p>			<p><strong>Ping (Latency) Test</strong></p>			<p>This test is performed by measuring the time it takes to get a response for a TCP request sent to the server. It is done 10 times with the average value determining the final result.</p>			<p><strong>Download Test</strong></p>			<p>A small binary file is downloaded from the server to the client to estimate the connection speed. Based on this result, one of several file sizes is selected to use for the real download test. The download test is performed with cache prevention via a random string appended to each download. Speed is measured up to 30 times per second. Ordered samples are looked at through a sliding average window to eliminate anomalies and determine the result.</p>			<p><strong>Upload Test</strong></p>			<p>A small amount of random data is generated in the client and sent to the server to estimate the speed of the connection. Based on this result, an appropriately sized set of randomly generated data is selected for upload. The upload test is then performed in chunks which are pushed to the server. An overall average is used to determine the result. The Speed Test is a true measurement of speed between the web server and client.</p>			<p><strong>HTTP Fallback</strong></p>			<p>In the case that TCP Port 5050 is not available, the Speed Test will fall back to using HTTP on Port 80. You may notice a slight delay when initiating a test.</p>		</div>	</div>	<div id="question2a" class="modalDialog">		<div>			<a href="#close" title="Close" class="close fa fa-times"></a>			<span class="heading">Why does <span class="uppercase">Xfinity</span> Speed Test say I need at least Flash version 8 when I already have it?</span>			<p><span class="uppercase">Xfinity</span> Speed Test uses JavaScript to detect your Flash version.

For example, when using a 3rd party speed test site, your traffic may travel over networks that are not controlled by Comcast. Those &quot;peering&quot; networks may have an effect on the overall speeds. In addition, the 3rd party's test engines could be using a single threaded TCP connection during testing. This counteracts the ability to reach higher speeds, as there is more wait time from the packets being sent and received from the 3rd party speed test server. Our speed test server is running 4 simultaneous threads, which is modeled to reflect normal browsing across currently available websites. Also, the 3rd party site may not be using test files that are large enough to permit an accurate reading for speed tiers with higher speeds.</p>			<p>Actual speeds may vary and are not guaranteed.</p>		</div>	</div>	<div id="question2h" class="modalDialog">		<div>			<a href="#close" title="Close" class="close fa fa-times"></a>			<span class="heading">How does <span class="uppercase">Xfinity</span> Speed Test know where I am?</span>			<p><span class="uppercase">Xfinity</span> Speed Test uses GeoIP data from MaxMind to determine your location.

While Comcast provisions its network to provide up to the maximum speed available with your service, a number of factors affect speed and the actual speeds you receive may vary. Many of the factors affecting speed are beyond Comcast's control. For example, speed can be affected by the type of computer you have, the processing capacity of your computer, the applications running on your computer, and the nature of your home network connection. In addition, the websites you visit, the capabilities of third party networks, and congestion on the internet may affect internet speeds.</p>		</div>	</div>	<div id="question3a" class="modalDialog">		<div>			<a href="#close" title="Close" class="close fa fa-times"></a>			<span class="heading">Why would the capabilities of a website or a third party network affect my speeds?</span>			<p>Various websites cap the speeds at which consumers are permitted to download or stream content. Those websites may also become congested, which could further slow your connection to that website.</p>			<p>The internet has been described as a &quot;network of networks.&quot; Comcast's network is interconnected with the networks of a number of third parties and Comcast can only control the services on its own networks. If a third party's network is congested or has other limits on speed, you may not be able to achieve your provisioned download speeds to that specific website.</p>		</div>	</div>	<div id="question3b" class="modalDialog">		<div>			<a href="#close" title="Close" class="close fa fa-times"></a>			<span class="heading">Why are my wireless connection speeds slower than my wired connection speeds?</span>			<p>There are many variables that could impact your speed when connected to the internet through a wireless network. For example, microwaves, static electricity, fluorescent lights, windows, wall type and thickness, distance, band and signal settings, multiple devices on the same channel, and several other factors can impact the speeds you receive when wirelessly connected to the internet. These WiFi variables can add substantial delay which may result in speed degradation. A wired connection eliminates many of the potential variables of a wireless network, resulting in improved performance.
