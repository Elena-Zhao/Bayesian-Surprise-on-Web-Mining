<title>Student's t-Tests</title><h2>Student's <em>t</em>-Tests</h2>"Student" (real name: W. S. Gossett [1876-1937]) developed statistical methods to solve problems stemming from his employmentin a brewery.  Student's <em>t</em>-test deals with the problemsassociated with inference based on "small" samples: the calculatedmean (<em>X</em><sub>avg</sub>) and standard deviation (<img src="sigma2.gif" alt="sdev">)may by chance deviate from the "real"mean and standard deviation (i.e., what you'd measure if youhad many more data items: a "large" sample).  For example, it it likely that the truemean size of maple leaves is "close" to the mean calculated from a sample of<em>N</em> randomly collected leaves.  If <em>N</em>=5,95% of the time the actual mean would be in the range:<em>X</em><sub>avg</sub>&#177; 2.776 <img src="sigma2.gif" alt="sdev">/<em>N</em><sup>1/2</sup> ;if <em>N</em>=10:<em>X</em><sub>avg</sub>&#177; 2.262 <img src="sigma2.gif" alt="sdev">/<em>N</em><sup>1/2</sup> ;if <em>N</em>=20:<em>X</em><sub>avg</sub>&#177; 2.093 <img src="sigma2.gif" alt="sdev">/<em>N</em><sup>1/2</sup> ;if <em>N</em>=40;<em>X</em><sub>avg</sub>&#177; 2.023 <img src="sigma2.gif" alt="sdev">/<em>N</em><sup>1/2</sup> ;and for "large" <em>N</em>:<em>X</em><sub>avg</sub>&#177; 1.960 <img src="sigma2.gif" alt="sdev">/<em>N</em><sup>1/2</sup> .(These "small-sample" corrections are included in the descriptive statics reportof the 95% confidence interval.)<h3>Are two sets of data really different?</h3><a href="t-test_NROW_form.html">Click here to perform Student's <em>t</em>-test</a><p><a href="t-test_bulk_form.html">Click here to perform Student's <em>t</em>-test via copy and paste</a><p>If we have two collections of maple leaves (i.e., two samples), it is quite likely that in detailthe collections are different: different highs, lows, and average leaf sizes.Is the measured difference in average leaf size large enough that we shouldreject the null hypothesis that in fact such differences are due to "chance"?Given the above sortof information on the likely range for the actual mean ofeach sample, the questionbasically reduces to whether the likely ranges overlap (in which case the means<em>could</eM> be the same: in the overlap of the intervals, and we <em>may not</em> rejectthe null hypothesis) or if they do not overlap (in which case we must rejectthe null hypothesis: the difference is most likely not due to chance).  To report thevariety of possible outcomes: from means not "significantly" different to meansin fact "significantly" different, the probability that the difference is dueto chance is reported.  Reject the null hypothesis if <em>P</em> is "small".<h3>Paired Data</h3><a href="Paired_t-test_NROW_form.html">Click here to perform Paired Student's <em>t</em>-test</a><p>Very often the two samples to be compared are not randomly selected: the secondsample is the same as the first after some treatment has been applied.<p>Cedar-apple rust is a (non-fatal) disease that affects apple trees. Its most obvioussymptom is rust-colored spots on apple leaves.  Red cedar trees are the immediate source of the fungus that infects the apple trees.  If you could remove allred cedar trees within a few miles of the orchard, you should eliminate the problem.  In the first yearof this experiment the number of affected leaves on 8 trees was counted; the followingwinter all red cedar trees within 100 yards of the orchard were removed and the following yearthe same trees were examined for affected leaves.  The results are recorded below:<pre>tree    number of rusted     number of rusted    difference: 1-2        leaves: year 1       leaves: year 2        1            38                   32                6  2            10                   16               -6  3            84                   57               27  4            36                   28                8  5            50                   55               -5  6            35                   12               23  7            73                   61               12  8            48                   29               19average        46.8                 36.2             10.5standard dev   23                   19               12</pre>As you can see there is substantial natural variation in the numberof affected leaves; in fact, a unpaired <em>t</em>-test comparingthe results in year 1 and year 2 would find no significant difference.(Note that an unpaired <em>t</em>-test should not be applied to thisdata because the second sample was not in fact randomly selected.)However, if we focus on the difference we find that the averagedifference is significantly different from zero.  The paired <em>t</em>-testfocuses on the difference between the paired data and reports theprobability that the actual mean difference is consistent with zero.This comparison is aided by the reduction in variance achieved bytaking the differences.
