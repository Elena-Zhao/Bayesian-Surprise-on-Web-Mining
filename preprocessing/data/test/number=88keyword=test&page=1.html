When you measure bandwidth, be it <strong>DSL speed Test</strong>, <strong>Cable Modem Speed Test</strong> or any other, you have to consider the devices the packets of data travel through.  A speed test also has to consider the technology used to deliver those packets of data and account for variations in speed.</p><p>To give you the most accurate results, our <em>internet speed test</em> was based on a research paper by Liang Cheng2 and Ivan Marsic from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey.  The paper explains in detail how to accurately measure Digital Subscriber Line Networks and is used by our speed test.</p><p>In researching <strong>Broadband Speed Tests</strong>, we also found some very &#8216;unfriendly&#8217; user interfaces that left us confused as to the results.  We have put great effort into providing an accurate, easy to understand graphical interface that clearly displays the results of the internet speed test.</p><p>For those of you interested in greater detail, keep reading; otherwise, just click the speed test start button.  This speed test uses Java and will not work with java disabled.</p><p><strong>Internet Speed Test Definitions</strong></p><p>The following internet speed test terms are useful for understanding the Speed Test measurement report:</p><p>QOS</p><p>Represents the level of consistent download capacity provided by your Broadband or DSL provider. The higher QOS percentage, the higher the overall quality of the internet connection.  High quality plus internet speed provides better connections for VoIP (voice over IP), Citrix and other high traffic applications.</p><p>This figure should come in around 80 or higher yet.  This does not mean that you won&#8217;t find success at lower speeds, but on average, the speed test should report >= 80.</p><p>RTT</p><p>The Round Trip Time (RTT) reports the total time in milliseconds (ms) to send a small data packet in our internet speed test and obtain a reply back. The faster (smaller) the RTT, the better broadband speed you&#8217;ll have.</p><p>For Voice over IP, round trip delays can occur when results exceed 250 mSec or 150 mSec one way which is also considered the maximum desired one-way latency to achieve high-quality voice.</p><p>Max Pause</p><p>Max Pause is the longest pause recorded during the Broadband Speed Test data download. This should be a very small number. If not, it could indicate Internet speed congestion or a bad broadband connection.</p><p>Anything less that 100 would be ideal for this broadband speed test. </p><h3>Speed Test &#8211; How It Works</h3><p>Existing Internet Speed Tests &#8211; <em>bandwidth testing</em> techniques are not suitable because link asymmetry and ATM traffic shaping in xDSL deployments impact the accuracy of their speed test measurements.</p><p><strong>Speed Test &#8211; Techniques</strong></p><p>A number of techniques exist for <em>Speed Test</em> and bandwidth measurement. Most of them can be categorized into two groups. One group is a variant of pathchar based on the one-packet model. The disadvantage of this group is heavy overhead in bandwidth consumption. The other is a variant of packet-pair based on the packet-pair model. This group imposes lower overhead compared to the first group.</p><p>In theory, one- or two-packet techniques and the tailgating technique in internet speed tests and can get good estimation of xDSL link bandwidth. However, the existing tools do not regulate the probe packets so that ATM traffic shaper will regulate the probe packets for them by packet delay or packet drop.</p><p>One possible solution is that to explicitly regulate the probe traffic, but then it is difficult to specify the source rate for <em>speed tests</em>. That is why a stepwise scheme is proposed: in the first step of the bandwidth test, a rough estimate of the bandwidth is obtained and the subsequent probe traffic is regulated according to the estimation. Multi-packet technique is used to avoid explicit packet filtering to help accurately measure internet speed.</p><p><strong>Broadband Tests &#8211; Traffic Shaping</strong></p><p>Our <em>broadband speed test</em> take into account that ATM traffic shaping has a goal of regulating the traffic flow as per the parameters describing the negotiated QoS to achieve better network efficiency. The basic idea of ATM traffic shaping is buffering the packets/cells and controlling, mostly delaying, their entry into the network, thereby ensuring a more constant flow of traffic in the network.</p><p><img src="http://www.auditmypc.com/images/broadband-speed-test.jpg" alt="Broadband Speed Test" width="398" height="126" border="0" /></p><p><strong>DSL Speed Test &#8211; Application to Asymmetric DSL Networks</strong></p><p>The <strong>DSL Speed Test</strong> understands that the asymmetric nature of ADSL networks makes it necessary to have different measurements methodologies for upstream and downstream cases.  The speed tests are based upon the assumption that the upstream bandwidth is lower than the downstream bandwidth.</p><p><strong>DSL Speed Test &#8211; Upstream methodology</strong></p><p><img src="http://www.auditmypc.com/images/dsl-speed-test.jpg" alt="DSL Speed Test" width="396" height="261" border="0" /></p><p>A fixed number of UDP packets of uniform size are sent from the customer&#8217;s computer (client) at a rate slightly higher than the nominal bottleneck bandwidth of the ADSL network during our DSL speed test. Probing traffic with the slightly higher rate (e.g., less than 10%) is necessary to saturate the pipe for testing. A server process on the Bandwidth Measurement Server, echoes back the packets as they arrive at the server end. The time difference, T, is measured between the arrival of the first packet and the last packet at the client end. During the broadband speed test, the upstream bottleneck link bandwidth, b1, is computed as: b1 = (NxPx8)/T [bps]</p><p><strong>Bandwidth Test &#8211; Downstream methodology</strong></p><p><img src="http://www.auditmypc.com/images/internet-speed-test.jpg" alt="Internet Speed Test 3" width="408" height="270" border="0" /></p><p>A traffic generator at the Bandwidth Speed Test Measurement Server generates a downstream traffic. A receiving process at the client measures the arrival time of the packets. Because of the nature of ADSL, such that the upstream bandwidth is smaller than the downstream bandwidth, the client does not echo the probe packets back. Instead, the client computes the downstream bandwidth to accurately check internet speed.</p><p><strong>Bandwidth Speed Test &#8211; Stepwise Scheme</strong></p><p>The stepwise scheme consists of at least two steps during the <strong>speed test</strong>. It can be used for both downstream and upstream bandwidth measurements described in the previous section. The generated traffic should be smooth rather than bursty to avoid excessive ATM traffic shaping. The stepwise bandwidth measurement scheme runs several times and reports the maximum measured value as the link bandwidth.</p><p>During the first bandwidth measurement step, a small number of packets, e.g., 10, are sent sequentially back-to-back from the client to the server. This small number of packets will likely not be affected by ATM traffic shaping, as most ATM networks are capable of handling such small bursts. The computed result is used in the second step of the <em>speed test</em> as the trial bandwidth of the xDSL link.</p><p>The subsequent step(s) in our internet speed test assumes that the accurate xDSL bandwidth is close to the trial result obtained from the first step. A larger number of packets than that in the first step are used in the measurement to ensure that the results are convergent and in the end consistent. Had it not been for the first step that approximately determined the bandwidth, the sustained higher-than-provisioned traffic would result in a considerable loss or queuing delay caused by ATM traffic shaping, and this would end up providing inaccurate <em>internet speed test results</em>.</p><p><a name="internetspeedtest-mbps"></a><br /><strong>Is it Megabits or MegaBytes?</strong></p><p>Q) Is Mbps in the speed test graphic referring to &#8220;mega bits per second&#8221; or &#8220;mega bytes per second&#8221;?</p><p>A) It&#8217;s mega bits per second. A byte is a measurement of size while bps is a measure of speed such as sending something across the internet. An uppercase B always stands for &#8220;bytes&#8221; while a lowercase &#8220;b&#8221; always stands for &#8220;bits per second&#8221;.</p><ul><li>Kbps is spoken as Kilobits, equals 1,000 bits per second and is also abbreviated Kb or Kbits</li><li>Mbps is spoken as Megabits, equals 1 million (1,000,000) bits per second and is also abbreviated Mb or Mbits</li><li>Gbps is spoken as Gigabits, equals 1 billion (1,000,000,000) bits per second and is also abbreviated Gb or Gbits</li></ul><p><strong>Internet Speed Test &#8211; Conclusion</strong></p><p>In Summary, we have put a lot of time into designing the most accurate and easy to use <em>speed test</em> on the internet, and for free!

Since you have gone to the trouble to set up this area for posting of comments. If you are not going to do the right thing, then just simply discontinue the feature since the service is not being performed anyway. You will lose less consumer interest and traffic that way and people won&#8217;t be so annoyed with you. You would actually see an increase in traffic because less people would abandon you for lack of your interest. Then set up a special page where people who are having trouble with your site can get a response and follow up with actual useful answers. A FAQ page will help keep repeat questions down.

Next, using your \broadband test\ I get (139k/135ms/712k).   This is consistent after updating java to 1.6.0_24 (64 bit XP).<br /> I had previously checked several sites on XP64, Win7-64, and Ubuntu 10.10 using Ookla and on DSLreports flash and java, and finally on FIOS bandwidth test site.  All of these tests show results similar to your slower results.  Next, the detailed test at UM-Flint (speedtest.umflint.edu/ only on XP) notes packet queuing took place and \thoeretical network limit of 0.3Mb/s,\ with 691kb/92kb speed.<br /> Yes, there are lots of variables and I m just off extensive repairs and updates by Verizon on their copper and plant setups.  The download speeds dropped after the \fixes\, so I wonder if some kind of traffic shaping may be at fault.</p>		</div><!-- end .comment-content -->		<div class="reply">					</div>			</li><!-- #comment-## -->	<li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="comment-15107">				<div class="comment-author vcard">						<cite class="fn">Eric</cite> <span class="says">says:</span>	 	</div><!-- end .comment-author -->		<div class="comment-meta commentmetadata">			February 24, 2011 at 7:01 am					</div><!-- end .comment-meta -->		<div class="comment-content">						<p>Excellent speed test tool</p>		</div><!-- end .comment-content -->		<div class="reply">					</div>			</li><!-- #comment-## -->	<li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="comment-15000">				<div class="comment-author vcard">						<cite class="fn">amal</cite> <span class="says">says:</span>	 	</div><!-- end .comment-author -->		<div class="comment-meta commentmetadata">			February 20, 2011 at 1:35 am					</div><!-- end .comment-meta -->		<div class="comment-content">						<p>i hav put this speed test in my site ::: but getting download error when running speed test  ;; can anybody help &#8230; pls</p>		</div><!-- end .comment-content -->		<div class="reply">					</div>			</li><!-- #comment-## -->	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-admin bypostauthor odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="comment-14946">				<div class="comment-author vcard">						<cite class="fn">Jim</cite> <span class="says">says:</span>	 	</div><!-- end .comment-author -->		<div class="comment-meta commentmetadata">			February 18, 2011 at 6:01 pm					</div><!-- end .comment-meta -->		<div class="comment-content">						<p>Hi Ed, </p><p>Not at all and it&#8217;s my favorite speed test.

I use a Macbook Pro with OSX 10.6.5 and usually have used Camino as my browser, along with Safari or Firefox when I&#8217;ve having slowdown or connection issues. Recently I&#8217;ve begun to use Chrome. It is fast.</p><p>I&#8217;ve had a supposedly 7 Mbps DSL connection with Qwest which was consistently testing at 5-6 Mbps and have switched to a new Clear. com Hotspot using 4G Technology, to save money. I&#8217;ve been trying to run tests at different times with different testers to determine if the switch is going to be acceptable. (early results show it is, with bursts of speed to 8-9Mbps and consistent results at 4-5 Mbps, a little slower, but acceptable)</p><p>Now, the Internet speed test gives a &#8220;Connection refused&#8221; warning, except in Camino, which doesn&#8217;t give any type of reason for not running the test. All 4 of them show a split second image of the normal progress bars with &#8220;working&#8230;&#8221; showing and then give the &#8220;connection refused&#8221; warning. I am conducting the tests with each single browser running alone and with all 4 running at once. No other apps running at all. I&#8217;m using airport as my connection to the 4G Hotspot modem. I have the latest versions of Java and of Flash installed. The Broadband speed test consistently works fine, as do testers on another site, altho&#8217; your Broadband speed test shows almost half the speed that the other test does. Could you tell me why so large a difference? And, will I ever be able to use your Internet speed test while I&#8217;m connected using the 4G modem? I believe that will be the near future of wireless broadband connections, so I&#8217;d like to know how to do some accurate testing.</p><p>Thanks your help and for keeping these tests free!<br />Mark</p>		</div><!-- end .comment-content -->		<div class="reply">					</div>			</li><!-- #comment-## -->	<li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="comment-6099">				<div class="comment-author vcard">						<cite class="fn">braulio darias</cite> <span class="says">says:</span>	 	</div><!-- end .comment-author -->		<div class="comment-meta commentmetadata">			November 20, 2010 at 3:20 am					</div><!-- end .comment-meta -->		<div class="comment-content">						<p>my click not work that internet speed test i told if all right? ok thank you!</p>		</div><!-- end .comment-content -->		<div class="reply">					</div>			</li><!-- #comment-## -->	<li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="comment-6071">				<div class="comment-author vcard">						<cite class="fn">ot</cite> <span class="says">says:</span>	 	</div><!-- end .comment-author -->		<div class="comment-meta commentmetadata">			November 18, 2010 at 7:09 am					</div><!-- end .comment-meta -->		<div class="comment-content">						<p>I love the speed test and and appreciate the free service!

You use a usb stick and install a bootable version of Ubuntu (awesome OS by the way!) on the stick which you can then boot up from and surf the web. It&#8217;s easy to make and allows you to take this internet speed test without anything else running in the background &#8211; gives you the true speed!<br />Check out unetbootin.sourceforge.net</p><p>Hope that helps :)</p>		</div><!-- end .comment-content -->		<div class="reply">					</div>			</li><!-- #comment-## -->	<li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="comment-4740">				<div class="comment-author vcard">						<cite class="fn">sam</cite> <span class="says">says:</span>	 	</div><!-- end .comment-author -->		<div class="comment-meta commentmetadata">			September 16, 2010 at 4:26 am					</div><!-- end .comment-meta -->		<div class="comment-content">						<p>Hello,<br />I am on my mother&#8217;s computer, and it is very slow all of the time.

I don&#8217;t understand why BT in the UK don&#8217;t advertise this solution widely but persist with their stupid &#8216;I-plate&#8217; which just cuts out the ring wires.</p><p>Anyway, to cut to the chase, having at last achieved a stable connection I decided to repeat my broadband speedtest survey of several months ago.<br />In the early hours of the morning (yes I suppose I must be a geek) I measured the speed using 10 &#8216;testers&#8217;.</p><p>The results were quite interesting: 6 gave a result 5.1 +/- .1 Mb, including the BT speedtester itself, two gave a result &gt;100Mb including Namesco and your &#8216;Broadband Speedtest&#8217;, the one with dials, and your &#8216;Internet Speed Test&#8217; gave 4.0. Previous measurements using this test method over the past two weeks have fallen in the range 3.7 &#8211; 4.0, never higher.</p><p>The computers, software, antivirus etc were as described previously.<br />Interestingly my hub has shown a rock steady DSL connection rate at 6.336 Mb for the past 14 days which should yield, on previous experience, a measured speed of 80% connection speed = 5.1 Mb.</p><p>The empirical conclusion one might draw from this is that when one has a stable speed, your internet test seems to underestimate it relative to other methods.<br />I hope this stimulates much more interesting comment because I enjoy the discussions.</p><p>Thanks.</p>		</div><!-- end .comment-content -->		<div class="reply">					</div>			</li><!-- #comment-## -->	<li class="comment odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="comment-2920">				<div class="comment-author vcard">						<cite class="fn">Tenzin</cite> <span class="says">says:</span>	 	</div><!-- end .comment-author -->		<div class="comment-meta commentmetadata">			June 25, 2010 at 1:04 am					</div><!-- end .comment-meta -->		<div class="comment-content">						<p>Thanks.. worked fine for me.</p>		</div><!-- end .comment-content -->		<div class="reply">					</div>			</li><!-- #comment-## -->	<li class="comment even thread-even depth-1" id="comment-2893">				<div class="comment-author vcard">						<cite class="fn">ramreddy</cite> <span class="says">says:</span>	 	</div><!-- end .comment-author -->		<div class="comment-meta commentmetadata">			June 24, 2010 at 12:46 pm					</div><!-- end .comment-meta -->		<div class="comment-content">						<p>Very good test, thank you!</p>		</div><!-- end .comment-content -->		<div class="reply">					</div>			</li><!-- #comment-## -->	<li class="comment byuser comment-author-admin bypostauthor odd alt thread-odd thread-alt depth-1" id="comment-2884">				<div class="comment-author vcard">						<cite class="fn">Jim</cite> <span class="says">says:</span>	 	</div><!-- end .comment-author -->		<div class="comment-meta commentmetadata">			June 24, 2010 at 6:47 am					</div><!-- end .comment-meta -->		<div class="comment-content">						<p>Hello Tomas, </p><p>Sure, you can store the results to a database or file and assign them to a user, ip address, etc. Whatever you can think of.</p><p>However, the speed tests are for personal use, such as a personal website.

I used this tester for many months since it always gave results which were compatible with a thing called &#8216;BT speedtester&#8217; which is the &#8216;approved&#8217; tester for ISP BT customers in the UK but takes an age to come up with an answer. Currently I have three laptops connected to a BT hub, one wired and two wireless. Two of these relatively new machines run fully updated XP and one fully updated Vista(ugh). All have updated versions of Java and various browsers, including IE8, Firefox, Safari. All three machines use Avira for security.</p><p>All three of these machines give the &#8216;connect time out&#8217; non-result using your speedtester, and have done, in addition to other machines I have set up over the past couple of months, in whatever browser configuration I use. Avira is NOT the problem, I have used it continuously for two years. My house is in a &#8216;rural&#8217; setting, some way from the nearest exchange, so I only get a measured speed of around 2.5 M. My lines, filters, junction boxes have all been recently checked out by BT engineers. I am now using &#8216;Broadband Watchdog&#8217; for testing.
