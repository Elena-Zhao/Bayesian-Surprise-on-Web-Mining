She had just gotten back her score on the ACT test. It was not what she had hoped for. In fact, it was not even close to the expectations she had and what she thought her 4.0 grade point average would help her score on the ACT test.<p>The worst part was that she knew that she could never get into the university she had planned to go to with an ACT test score that low.<p>Then she remembered her friends and felt even worse. All of her closest high school friends had already gotten their ACT test scores back and had already been accepted into the university they all planned to attend together. She had been procrastinating about taking the ACT test, because she hated standardized tests, and this only confirmed her hatred.<p>&quot;Why do you have to take the ACT test to get into college?&quot; she angrily wondered.<p>She didn't look forward to having to tell the embarrassing news to her friends. &quot;What would they think of her?&quot; she thought, eyes brimming with tears, as she imagined her friends starting college without her and the isolation and exclusion of being the one left behind.<h2>How to Solve the Problem</h2><p>Unfortunately, this hypothetical situation occurs all the time. Someone thought they were going to a prestigious university, told all of their friends, made plans for the future, picked out a degree, and then got an embarrassing reality check from their score on the ACT test.<p>Contrary to popular belief, the ACT test is not a measure of your academic performance, which is why students with a perfect 4.0 GPA rarely score a perfect 36 on the ACT test.<p>The ACT test is quite simply a measure of how well you did on the ACT test, which can be broken down into individual subtest scores on the English, Math, Reading, Science Reasoning, and optional Writing sections.<p>Colleges and universities use the ACT test as a standardized measuring stick to determine who gets admitted and who benefits from the best scholarships they have to offer. While it may not be fair, a student's entire academic career in high school can be completely overshadowed by a single score on the ACT test.<p>That is the whole purpose of the <b><i>ACT Exam Secrets</i></b> study guide: to give students the keys to understand how to succeed on the ACT test.<h2>An ACT Test Study Guide Unlike Any Other</h2><p>If you'd like to get the ACT test score you deserve, to quit worrying about whether your score on the ACT test is &quot;good enough,&quot; and to beat the test taking game, then this might be the most important message you read this year.<p>Our comprehensive study guide for the ACT test is written by our ACT test experts, who painstakingly researched the topics and the concepts that you need to know to ace your ACT test. Our original research into the ACT test, offered by the ACT, Inc., reveals the specific content areas and the essential skills that are critical for you to know on the ACT test. We've taken the information and developed a study guide that is guaranteed to help you be successful on the ACT test.<p>Now, we know you may be skeptical, so let us give you three good reasons we can back up what we claim:<!--SG The Three Reasons Start--><h2>The Three Reasons To Believe What We Say</h2><p><span class="u">The First Reason:</span><p>Our company's name is Mometrix Test Preparation, and we have a team of standardized test researchers who have worked on developing our study guide for the ACT test. The standards for who gets to work on the team are very strict- we demand the best for our customers, and only those who met our exacting standards made the cut. The dedicated research staff have years of combined experience in mastering the content and skills necessary to succeed on the toughest exams.<p><span class="u">The Second Reason:</span><p>Some academic studies have revealed that test takers do not really benefit from the traditional test preparation process. But we knew there had to be a solution- if test takers were not doing well on the ACT test despite high intelligence, there had to be a set of secret keys to the test that would open the door of success for these test takers.<p>We believe we have succeeded in finding the secret keys of the exam. What we found was surprising, and in some cases <span class="u">ridiculously simple</span> once explained to the average test taker.<p>We put the findings together in a thorough, concise study guide that we believe allows any test taker, at any skill level, to <span class="u"><b>improve his or her results dramatically</b></span> with a <i>minimum of effort</i>.<p><span class="u">The Third Reason:</span><p>We created the product in part because we were frustrated by the options available to test takers who really wanted to do well on the ACT test.<p>A common approach is to TEACH the material, instead of TEACHING THE TEST. That's not necessarily good enough for the ACT test- you have to know how to apply the knowledge. Most test takers already have a general knowledge of the material that will be covered on the exam.<p>One reason some test takers do well on the day of the test is that they have made the critical connection between the material they learned and how to use the material to succeed on the ACT test.<p>Our guide addresses the difference between merely knowing the material and knowing how to use the material to <span class="u">perform on test day</span>.<p>You're going to save time, money, and aggravation. You'll learn to avoid the mistakes and the bad strategies that you've been vulnerable to. Just for starters, here are some ways our product can help your score on the ACT test...<!--SG Techniques Start--><h2>The Exclusive Test Taking Techniques</h2><ul class="list-style-check"><li>Explains how the ACT test time limits are the #1 enemy of most students, and what you can do about it- You avoid falling into the many &quot;time traps&quot; built into the test, giving you an immeasurable advantage over those who go into the test unaware<li>Shows you super speed methods to get through the questions you know with ease- Saving you time so you can concentrate on the hardest questions without having to rush<li>Allows you to recognize critical &quot;hedge&quot; words - You'll understand their significance so you're not caught off guard<li>Get quick, customized help for the questions you have- just send us a quick email and we'll get back to you promptly with the answer.<li>Our researchers are more than just academic theoreticians who understand the technical nature of standardized tests, but are also experts on test taking itself- they reveal the exact skills and the information you'll need to perform under pressure during the test.<li>Keys to questions that &quot;give away&quot; the wrong (or right) answers- You get credit for some of the questions without really even knowing anything about them<li>Empowers you with a key word searching tips that will let you save more time than you thought possible- You won't be wasting precious time anymore scouring Reading passages, but will immediately be able to find exactly what you are looking for<li>Details the EXACT STUDY PLAN for the ACT test that we believe gives the most results in the least time- No matter if you're studying for a week or a month, you won't waste the precious study time you have on useless activities<li>Shows how to use ACT's score reporting system to your advantage- You can use ACT's own system against them to get a higher score- this technique is so obvious, we wonder in amazement why ACT allows such a gaping hole in their system!<li>A systematic analysis and the best breakdown into &quot;plain language&quot; of how to deconstruct and master word problems- You turn word problems that most students stumble over to your advantage<li>The secret keys to punctuation that &quot;gives away&quot; the right answer a lot of the time- You know the special &quot;flags&quot; and the specific &quot;giveaways&quot; to look for on these English questions<li>The most efficient and accurate method for picking the right answer on Science Reasoning questions- You won't be scratching your head trying to read the mind of the test question writer, but will instead know exactly what to look for to pick the best answer<li>Learn why, when, and how to guess to your advantage.

I just want to thank you again, and hope you have continued success in your ventures. Sincerely, Paul L.<p>My name is Chris. I used the Secrets study guide for five days. The study guide made the test so easy to understand. Like you said this program is worth 100's of dollars. To me 1,000's!! THANKS, Chris G.<p>I just had to thank you guys for the test prep! I bought the guide as a last minute prep, I mean maybe 5 hours before the test. Like I said, I had ZERO preparation! I was nervous about the test let alone receiving the score I needed. I read the guide through only once before test time and needless to say, the only way I passed was thanks to your refresher!! Brian<p>Just dropping you a note to let you know that I am completely satisfied with the product. I had already taken the test once and landed in the 75 percentile of those taking it with me. I took the test a second time and used some of your tips and raised my score to the 97 percentile. Thanks for my much improved score. Denise W.<p>I heard about your website from a friend. I am enrolled in a review course, and in hindsight, I wish I wouldn't have taken my review course and instead spent a fraction of the money on your program. Thank you! Zac L..<!--SG Warning Start--><h3 class="red">Warning: Always Look for These 6 Criteria</h3><p>There is a lot of confusion surrounding studying for the ACT test, and standardized tests in general. In our opinion, these are the 6 criteria you should always look for in a study guide for the ACT test:<p><b>One:</b> The guide must be written by writers who have painstakingly researched the topics and concepts needed to succeed on the ACT test. The blind cannot hope to lead the blind.<p><b>Two:</b> The guide must be written in easy-to-use everyday language so all test takers can access the information.<p><b>Three:</b> The guide must be to-the-point, with no fluff to distract the test taker from the truly important information.<p><b>Four:</b> The guide must address the test first, the material second. If the material was the only thing that was important, then every test taker that understood the material should get a perfect score- that doesn't happen because there's a difference between simply knowing what's on the test and the way you perform on the test. You want a study guide to close that gap.<p><b>Five:</b> The guide must motivate the test taker to actually study for the exam. If the guide is hard to read, the time spent studying will be slow and painful, and the results will be meager.<p><b>Six:</b> The guide must be guaranteed- if you don't pass with flying colors, you get your money back- no questions asked.<!--SG 10 Times Start--><h2>You get at least 10 times your money's worth!</h2><p>When you consider what's at stake with the exam, we believe the value of our study guide gives you at least ten times your money's worth.<p>In summary, here's what you get:<p>When you buy <b><i>ACT Exam Secrets</i></b>, it includes-<p><b>The 5 Secret Keys to ACT Test Success:</b><ul class="list-style-check"><li>Time Is Your Greatest Enemy<li>Guessing is Not Guesswork<li>Practice Smarter, Not Harder<li>Make the ACT Test Work For You<li>Test Yourself</ul><p><b>The comprehensive English review including:</b><ul class="list-style-check"><li>Simplicity is Bliss<li>Recognizing Parallelism<li>Understanding Grammar Type<li>Keys to Using Punctuation<li>Beware of Added Phrases<li>Clearing Up Word Confusion<li>Comparative Methods<li>Nonessential Sections<li>Maintaining the Flow<li>Serial Mistakes</ul><p><b>The comprehensive Math review including:</b><ul class="list-style-check"><li>The Easiest Math Review You'll Ever Read<li>Solving for Variables<li>Breezing Through Word Problems<li>Keeping Probability Simple<li>Using the Right Formulas<li>Graphing for Success<li>Racing Through Ratios<li>Understanding Line Plotting<li>Mastering Difficult Problems</ul><p><b>The comprehensive Reading review including:</b><ul class="list-style-check"><li>Determining the Relationships<li>Making Strategic Eliminations<li>Recognizing the Switchback Words<li>Understanding Word Types<li>Finding the Right Opportunities<li>When Truth Doesn't Equal Correctness<li>Avoiding the Trap of Familiarity<li>Making Logic Work for You<li>Skimming Techniques to Save Time</ul><p><b>The comprehensive Science Reasoning review including:</b><ul class="list-style-check"><li>Strategic Choice Elimination<li>Using Similarities for Success<li>Experimental Explanations<li>How to Avoid Technicalities<li>Maintaining the Pace<li>Understanding the Flaws<li>Making Bizarre Decisions<li>Knowing for Certain<li>Deciphering Variables</ul><p><b>The comprehensive Writing review including:</b><ul class="list-style-check"><li>Approaching the Topic<li>Brainstorming for Success<li>Picking a Main Idea<li>Starting Your Engines<li>Strength Through Diversity<li>Weeding Your Garden<li>Creating a Logical Flow<li>Avoiding the Panic<li>Checking Your Work</ul><p>plus all of the other special tips and secrets we have included to help you prepare for the exam...<!--SG Bonuses Start--><h2>Receive the Following Bonuses</h2><p>Since we know it's 100% to your benefit to use our study guide, we want to further encourage you by also including the following with your order:<ul class="list-style-arrow"><li><strong>Bonus One</strong><p><b><i>ACT Exam Practice Test Questions-</i></b> Think you're ready for the ACT test?
