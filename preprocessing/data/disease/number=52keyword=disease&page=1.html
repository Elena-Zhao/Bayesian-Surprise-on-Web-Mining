Hyperthyroidism is a disorder that occurs when the thyroid gland makes more thyroid hormone than the body needs.</p>                            <h4>The Thyroid</h4>                            <p>The thyroid is a 2-inch-long, butterfly-shaped gland in the front of the neck below the larynx, or voice box. The thyroid makes two thyroid hormones, triiodothyronine (T<sub>3</sub> ) and thyroxine (T<sub>4</sub> ). T<sub>3</sub> is made from T<sub>4</sub> and is the more active hormone, directly affecting the tissues. Thyroid hormones circulate throughout the body in the bloodstream and act on virtually every tissue and cell in the body.</p>                            <p>Thyroid hormones affect metabolism, brain development, breathing, heart and nervous system functions, body temperature, muscle strength, skin dryness, menstrual cycles, weight, and cholesterol levels. Hyperthyroidism causes many of the body’s functions to speed up.</p>                            <p>Thyroid hormone production is regulated by another hormone called thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), which is made by the pituitary gland in the brain. When thyroid hormone levels in the blood are low, the pituitary releases more TSH. When thyroid hormone levels are high, the pituitary responds by decreasing TSH production.</p>                            <p>[<a href="#top" class="top">Top</a>]</p>                            <h4>Autoimmune Disorder</h4>                             <p>Graves’ disease is an autoimmune disorder. Normally, the immune system protects the body from infection by identifying and destroying bacteria, viruses, and other potentially harmful foreign substances. But in autoimmune diseases, the immune system attacks the body’s own cells and organs.</p>                               <p>With Graves’ disease, the immune system makes an antibody called thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulin (TSI)—sometimes called TSH receptor antibody—that attaches to thyroid cells. TSI mimics TSH and stimulates the thyroid to make too much thyroid hormone. Sometimes the TSI antibody instead blocks thyroid hormone production, leading to conflicting symptoms that may make correct diagnosis more difficult.</p>                           <h3 id="symptoms">What are the symptoms of Graves’ disease?</h3>                            <p>People with Graves’ disease may have common symptoms of hyperthyroidism such as</p>                            <ul>                <li>nervousness or irritability</li>                <li>fatigue or muscle weakness</li>                              <li>heat intolerance</li>                <li>trouble sleeping</li>                <li>hand tremors</li>                <li>rapid and irregular heartbeat</li>                <li>frequent bowel movements or diarrhea</li>                <li>weight loss</li>                              <li>goiter, which is an enlarged thyroid that may cause the neck to look swollen and can interfere with normal breathing and swallowing</li>              </ul>                            <p>A small number of people with Graves’ disease also experience thickening and reddening of the skin on their shins.

Blood tests and other diagnostic tests, such as the following, then confirm the diagnosis.</p>                            <p><strong>TSH test.</strong> The ultrasensitive TSH test is usually the first test performed. This test detects even tiny amounts of TSH in the blood and is the most accurate measure of thyroid activity available.</p>			<p><strong>T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> test.</strong> Another blood test used to diagnose Graves’ disease measures T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> levels. In making a diagnosis, health care providers look for below-normal levels of TSH, normal to elevated levels of T<sub>4</sub>, and elevated levels of T<sub>3</sub>.</p><p>Because the combination of low TSH and high T<sub>3</sub> and T<sub>4</sub> can occur with other thyroid problems, health care providers may order other tests to finalize the diagnosis. The following two tests use small, safe doses of radioactive iodine because the thyroid uses iodine to make thyroid hormone.</p><p><strong>Radioactive iodine uptake test.</strong> This test measures the amount of iodine the thyroid collects from the bloodstream. High levels of iodine uptake can indicate Graves’ disease.</p><p><strong>Thyroid scan.</strong> This scan shows how and where iodine is distributed in the thyroid. With Graves’ disease the entire thyroid is involved, so the iodine shows up throughout the gland. Other causes of hyperthyroidism such as nodules—small lumps in the gland—show a different pattern of iodine distribution.</p><p><strong>TSI test.</strong> Health care providers may also recommend the TSI test, although this test usually isn’t necessary to diagnose Graves’ disease. This test, also called a TSH antibody test, measures the level of TSI in the blood. Most people with Graves’ disease have this antibody, but people whose hyperthyroidism is caused by other conditions do not.</p><p>More information about testing for thyroid problems is provided by the National Endocrine and Metabolic Diseases Information Service (NEMDIS) in the fact sheet, <em>Thyroid Function Tests</em>, available at <a href="http://www.endocrine.niddk.nih.gov">www.endocrine.niddk.nih.gov</a>.</p>                            <p>[<a href="#top" class="top">Top</a>]</p>              <h3 id="treatment">How is Graves’ disease treated?</h3>                            <p>People with Graves’ disease have three treatment options: radioiodine therapy, medications, and thyroid surgery. Radioiodine therapy is the most common treatment for Graves’ disease in the United States. Graves’ disease is often diagnosed and treated by an endocrinologist—a doctor who specializes in the body’s hormone- secreting glands.</p>                            <h4>Radioiodine Therapy</h4>              <p>In radioiodine therapy, patients take radioactive iodine-131 by mouth. Because the thyroid gland collects iodine to make thyroid hormone, it will collect the radioactive iodine from the bloodstream in the same way. Iodine-131—stronger than the radioactive iodine used in diagnostic tests—gradually destroys the cells that make up the thyroid gland but does not affect other body tissues.</p>                            <p>Many health care providers use a large enough dose of iodine-131 to shut down the thyroid completely, but some prefer smaller doses to try to bring hormone production into the normal range. More than one round of radioiodine therapy may be needed. Results take time and people undergoing this treatment may not notice improvement in symptoms for several weeks or months.</p>                            <p>People with GO should talk with a health care provider about any risks associated with radioactive iodine treatments. Several studies suggest radioiodine therapy can worsen GO in some people. Other treatments, such as prescription steroids, may prevent this complication.</p>                            <p>Although iodine-131 is not known to cause birth defects or infertility, radioiodine therapy is not used in pregnant women or women who are breastfeeding. Radioactive iodine can be harmful to the fetus’ thyroid and can be passed from mother to child in breast milk. Experts recommend that women wait a year after treatment before becoming pregnant.</p>                            <p>Almost everyone who receives radioactive iodine treatment eventually develops hypothyroidism, which occurs when the thyroid does not make enough thyroid hormone. People with hypothyroidism must take synthetic thyroid hormone, a medication that replaces their natural thyroid hormone.</p>                            <h4>Medications</h4>                            <p><strong>Beta blockers.</strong> Health care providers may prescribe a medication called a beta blocker to reduce many of the symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as tremors, rapid heartbeat, and nervousness. But beta blockers do not stop thyroid hormone production.</p>                            <p><strong>Antithyroid medications.</strong> Health care providers sometimes prescribe antithyroid medications as the only treatment for Graves’ disease. Antithyroid medications interfere with thyroid hormone production but don’t usually have permanent results. Use of these medications requires frequent monitoring by a health care provider. More often, antithyroid medications are used to pretreat patients before surgery or radioiodine therapy, or they are used as supplemental treatment after radioiodine therapy.</p>                            <p>Antithyroid medications can cause side effects in some people, including</p>                            <ul>              	<li>allergic reactions such as rashes and itching</li>                <li>a decrease in the number of white blood cells in the body, which can lower a person’s resistance to infection</li>                <li>liver failure, in rare cases</li>              </ul>                            <p>In the United States, health care providers prescribe the antithyroid medication methimazole (Tapazole, Northyx) for most types of hyperthyroidism.</p>                            <p><strong>Antithyroid medications and pregnancy.</strong> Because pregnant and breastfeeding women cannot receive radioiodine therapy, they are usually treated with an antithyroid medication instead. However, experts agree that women in their first trimester of pregnancy should probably not take methimazole due to the rare occurrence of damage to the fetus.</p>                            <p>Another antithyroid medication, propylthiouracil (PTU), is available for women in this stage of pregnancy or for women who are allergic to or intolerant of methimazole and have no other treatment options. Health care providers may prescribe PTU for the first trimester of pregnancy and switch to methimazole for the second and third trimesters.</p>                            <p>Some women are able to stop taking antithyroid medications in the last 4 to 8 weeks of pregnancy due to the remission of hyperthyroidism that occurs during pregnancy. However, these women should continue to be monitored for recurrence of thyroid problems following delivery.</p>                            <p>Studies have shown that mothers taking antithyroid medications may safely breastfeed. However, they should take only moderate doses, less than 10−20 milligrams daily, of the antithyroid medication methimazole. Doses should be divided and taken after feedings, and the infants should be monitored for side effects.<sup><a href="#Ogunyemi">2</a></sup></p>                            <p>Women requiring higher doses of the antithyroid medication to control hyperthyroidism should not breastfeed.</p>			<p class="small" id="Ogunyemi"><sup>2</sup>Ogunyemi DA.

This presurgical treatment prevents a condition called thyroid storm—a sudden, severe worsening of symptoms—that can occur when hyperthyroid patients have general anesthesia.</p>                            <p>When surgery is used, many health care providers recommend the entire thyroid be removed to eliminate the chance that hyperthyroidism will return. If the entire thyroid is removed, lifelong thyroid hormone medication is necessary.</p>                            <p>Although uncommon, certain problems can occur in thyroid surgery. The parathyroid glands can be damaged because they are located very close to the thyroid. These glands help control calcium and phosphorous levels in the body. Damage to the laryngeal nerve, also located close to the thyroid, can lead to voice changes or breathing problems.</p>                            <p>But when surgery is performed by an experienced surgeon, less than 1 percent of patients have permanent complications.<sup><a href="#Yeung">1</a></sup> People who need help finding a surgeon can contact one of the organizations listed under <a href="#info">“For More Information.”</a></p>                            <h4>Eye Care</h4>                            <p>The eye problems associated with Graves’ disease may not improve following thyroid treatment, so the two problems are often treated separately.</p>                            <p>Eye drops can relieve dry, gritty, irritated eyes—the most common of the milder symptoms. If pain and swelling occur, health care providers may prescribe a steroid such as prednisone. Other medications that suppress the immune response may also provide relief.</p>                            <p>Special lenses for glasses can help with light sensitivity and double vision. People with eye symptoms may be advised to sleep with their head elevated to reduce eyelid swelling. If the eyelids do not fully close, taping them shut at night can help prevent dry eyes.</p>                            <p>In more severe cases, external radiation may be applied to the eyes to reduce inflammation. Like other types of radiation treatment, the benefits are not immediate; most people feel relief from symptoms 1 to 2 months after treatment.</p>                            <p>Surgery may be used to improve bulging of the eyes and correct the vision changes caused by pressure on the optic nerve. A procedure called orbital decompression makes the eye socket bigger and gives the eye room to sink back to a more normal position.

After treatment with surgery or radioactive iodine, TSI antibodies can still be present in the blood, even when thyroid levels are normal.
