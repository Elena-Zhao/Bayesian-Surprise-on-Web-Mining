nervous system.&nbsp;It was first described in 1817 by James                                       Parkinson, a British physician who published a paper on what he called "the shaking palsy." In this paper, he described the                                       major signs and symptoms of the disease that would later bear his name.                                    </p>                                    <p>Research suggests at least 500,000 people in the United States currently have PD, although some estimates are much higher.                                       Society pays an enormous price for PD. The total cost to the nation is estimated to exceed $6 billion annually.&nbsp;The risk of                                       PD increases with age, so it is expected that the financial and public health impact of this disease will increase as the                                       population gets older.                                    </p>                                 </div>                              </div>                           </topic_body><a name="267843159"></a><h2>What is Parkinson's Disease?</h2><br><topic_body>                              <div xmlns:o="urn:www.microsoft.com/office" xmlns:st1="urn:www.microsoft.com/smarttags" xmlns:w="urn:www.microsoft.com/word" class="rxbodyfield">                                 <p>Parkinson's disease belongs to a group of conditions called movement disorders. The four main symptoms are <i>tremor,</i> or trembling in hands, arms, legs, jaw, or head; <i>rigidity,</i> or stiffness of the limbs and trunk; <i>bradykinesia,</i> or slowness of movement; and <i>postural instability</i>, or impaired balance. These symptoms usually begin gradually and worsen with time.&nbsp;As they become more pronounced, patients                                    may have difficulty walking, talking, or completing other simple tasks.&nbsp;Not everyone with one or more of these symptoms has                                    PD, as the symptoms appear in other diseases as well.                                 </p>                                 <p>PD is both chronic, meaning it persists over a long period of time, and progressive, meaning its symptoms grow worse over                                    time. Unlike measles, you cannot catch Parkinson&#8217;s disease from someone else. Although some cases of PD are hereditary and                                    can be traced to specific genetic mutations, most cases are sporadic&#8212;that is, the disease does not typically run in families.&nbsp;PD                                    likely results from a combination of genetic susceptibility and exposure to one or more environmental factors that trigger                                    the disease.                                 </p>                                 <p>PD is the most common form of <i>parkinsonism</i>, the name for a group of disorders with similar features and symptoms.&nbsp;PD is also called idiopathic PD. The term idiopathic                                    means a disorder for which no cause has been found. While most forms of parkinsonism are idiopathic, there are some cases                                    where the cause is known or suspected or where the symptoms result from another disorder.                                 </p>                              </div>                           </topic_body><a name="267853159"></a><h2>What Causes the Disease?</h2><br><topic_body>                              <div xmlns:o="urn:www.microsoft.com/office" xmlns:st1="urn:www.microsoft.com/smarttags" xmlns:w="urn:www.microsoft.com/word" class="rxbodyfield">                                 <p>Parkinson's disease occurs when nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain die or become impaired. The main area affected is an                                    area near the base of the brain called the <i>substantia nigra</i>.&nbsp;Normally, the neurons in this area produce an important brain chemical known as <i>dopamine</i>. Dopamine is a chemical messenger responsible for transmitting signals between the substantia nigra and the next "relay station"                                    of the brain, the <i>corpus striatum</i>, to produce smooth, purposeful movement. Loss of dopamine results in abnormal nerve firing patterns within the brain that                                    cause impaired movement. Studies have shown that most people with Parkinson's have lost 60 to 80 percent or more of the dopamine-producing                                    cells in the substantia nigra by the time symptoms appear, and that people with PD also have loss of the nerve endings that                                    produce the <i>neurotransmitter</i> norepinephrine. Norepinephrine, which is closely related to dopamine, is the main chemical messenger of the sympathetic nervous                                    system, the part of the nervous system that controls many automatic functions of the body, such as pulse and blood pressure.                                    The loss of norepinephrine might explain several of the non-motor features seen in PD, including fatigue and abnormalities                                    of blood pressure regulation.                                 </p>                                 <p>Many brain cells of people with PD contain Lewy bodies&#8212;deposits of the protein alpha-synuclein.&nbsp;Researchers do not yet know                                    why Lewy bodies form or what role they play in the disease.&nbsp;Some research suggests that the cell&#8217;s protein disposal system                                    may fail in people with PD, causing proteins to build up to harmful levels and trigger cell death.&nbsp; Additional studies have                                    found evidence that clumps of protein that develop inside brain cells of people with PD may contribute to the death of neurons.&nbsp;                                    However, the precise role of the protein deposits remains unknown.&nbsp; Some researchers even speculate that this protein buildup                                    is part of an unsuccessful attempt to protect the cell.                                 </p>                                 <p>Scientists have identified several genetic mutations associated with PD, and many more genes have been tentatively linked                                    to the disorder.&nbsp;Studying the genes responsible for inherited cases of PD can help researchers understand both inherited and                                    sporadic cases. The same genes and proteins that are altered in inherited cases may also be altered in sporadic cases by environmental                                    toxins or other factors. Researchers also hope that discovering genes will help identify new ways of treating PD.                                 </p>                                 <p>In addition to genetics, environmental exposures may increase a person's risk of developing the disease. Even in familial                                    cases, exposure to toxins or other environmental factors may influence when symptoms of the disease appear or how the disease                                    progresses. There are a number of toxins that can cause parkinsonian symptoms in humans.&nbsp;Other, still-unidentified environmental                                    factors also may cause PD in genetically susceptible individuals.&nbsp;Inflammation or overstimulation of cells (because of toxins                                    or other factors) may play a role in the disease.                                 </p>                                 <p>Several lines of research suggest that mitochondria may play a role in the development of PD. Mitochondria are the energy-producing                                    components of the cell and abnormalities in the mitochondria are major sources of free radicals&#8212;molecules that damage membranes,                                    proteins, DNA, and other parts of the cell. This damage is often referred to as oxidative stress. Oxidative stress-related                                    changes, including free radical damage to DNA, proteins, and fats, have been detected in brains of PD patients.                                 </p>                                 <p>While mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, and many other cellular processes may contribute to PD, the                                    actual initial cause of the dopamine cell death is still undetermined.                                 </p>                              </div>                           </topic_body><a name="267983159"></a><h2>What Genes are Linked to Parkinson's Disease?</h2><br><topic_body>                              <div xmlns:o="urn:www.microsoft.com/office" xmlns:st1="urn:www.microsoft.com/smarttags" xmlns:w="urn:www.microsoft.com/word" class="rxbodyfield">                                 <div>                                    <p>Several genes have now been definitively linked to PD. The first to be identified was alpha-synuclein. In the 1990s, researchers                                       at NIH and other institutions studied the genetic profiles of a large Italian family and three Greek families with familial                                       PD and found that their disease was related to a mutation in this gene. They found a second alpha-synuclein mutation in a                                       German family with PD. These findings prompted studies of the role of alpha-synuclein in PD, which led to the discovery that                                       Lewy bodies (abnormal masses of protein that develop inside nerve cells) seen in sporadic PD contain alpha-synuclein protein.                                       This discovery revealed a potential link between hereditary and sporadic forms of the disease.                                    </p>                                    <p>In 2003, researchers studying inherited PD discovered that the disease in one large family was caused by a triplication of                                       the normal alpha-synuclein gene on one copy of chromosome 4.&nbsp;This triplication caused people in the affected family to produce                                       too much of the normal alpha-synuclein.&nbsp;This study showed that an excess of the normal form of the protein could result in                                       PD, just as the abnormal form does.                                    </p>                                    <p>Other genes linked to PD include parkin, DJ-1, PINK1, and LRRK2. DJ-1 and PINK1 cause rare, early-onset forms of PD.&nbsp;The parkin                                       gene is translated into a protein that normally helps cells break down and recycle proteins.&nbsp;DJ-1 normally helps regulate                                       gene activity and protect cells from oxidative stress.&nbsp;PINK1 codes for a protein active in mitochondria. Mutations in this                                       gene appear to increase susceptibility to cellular stress.                                    </p>                                    <p>Mutations in LRRK2 were originally identified in several English and Basque families as a cause of a late-onset PD.&nbsp;Subsequent                                       studies have identified mutations this gene in other families with PD as well as in a small percentage of people with apparently                                       sporadic PD.                                    </p>                                    <p>Another interesting association is with the GBA gene, which makes the enzyme glucocerebrosidase.&nbsp;Mutations in this gene cause                                       Gaucher disease (in which fatty acids, oils, waxes, and steroids accumulate in the brain), but different changes in this gene                                       are associated with an increased risk for Parkinson&#8217;s disease as well.&nbsp;Studies trying to see what this association can tell                                       us about Parkinson risk in general are ongoing.                                    </p>                                 </div>                              </div>                           </topic_body><a name="267863159"></a><h2>Who Gets Parkinson's Disease?</h2><br><topic_body>                              <div xmlns:o="urn:www.microsoft.com/office" xmlns:st1="urn:www.microsoft.com/smarttags" xmlns:w="urn:www.microsoft.com/word" class="rxbodyfield">                                 <p>About 50,000 Americans are diagnosed with PD each year, but getting an accurate count of the number of cases is difficult                                    because many people in the early stages of the disease may assume their symptoms are the result of normal aging and do not                                    seek medical attention.

For example, people with PD-related depression may be prescribed antidepressants.                                 </p>                                 <ul>                                    <li>                                       <p><b>Levodopa.</b>&nbsp;The cornerstone of therapy for PD is the drug levodopa (also called L-dopa). Nerve cells can use levodopa to make dopamine                                          and replenish the brain's reduced supply. People cannot simply take dopamine pills because dopamine does not easily pass through                                          the blood-brain barrier, a lining of cells inside blood vessels that regulates the transport of oxygen, glucose, and other                                          substances into the brain.&nbsp; Usually, people are given levodopa combined with another substance called carbidopa. When added                                          to levodopa, carbidopa delays the conversion of levodopa into dopamine until it reaches the brain, preventing or diminishing                                          some of the side effects that can accompany levodopa therapy.&nbsp;Levodopa is often very successful at reducing the tremors and                                          other motor symptoms of PD during the early stages of the disease.&nbsp;It allows the majority of people with PD to extend the                                          period of time in which they can lead active, productive lives.                                       </p>                                       <p>Although levodopa helps most people with PD, not all symptoms respond equally to the drug. Levodopa usually helps most with                                          bradykinesia and rigidity. Problems with balance may not be responsive.                                       </p>                                       <p>People often see noticeable improvement in their symptoms after starting levodopa therapy.&nbsp;However, they may need to increase                                          the dose gradually for maximum benefit. Proteins can interfere with the absorption of levodopa from the stomach, so it may                                          sometimes be necessary to avoid taking the medication close to a meal. Levodopa is often so effective that some people may                                          temporarily forget they have PD during the early stages of the disease. But levodopa is not a cure. Although it can reduce                                          the symptoms of PD, it does not replace lost nerve cells and it does not stop the progression of the disease.                                       </p>                                       <p>Levodopa can have a variety of side effects. The most common initial side effects include nausea, low blood pressure, and                                          restlessness. The drug also can cause drowsiness or sudden sleep onset, which can make driving and other activities dangerous.&nbsp;Long-term                                          use of levodopa sometimes causes hallucinations and psychosis.&nbsp;The nausea and vomiting caused by levodopa are greatly reduced                                          by combining levodopa and carbidopa.                                       </p>                                       <p><i>Dyskinesias</i>, or involuntary movements such twisting and writhing, commonly develop in people who take levodopa over an extended period.                                          These movements may be either mild or severe. The dosage of levodopa is sometimes reduced in order to lessen these drug-induced                                          movements; however, the PD symptoms often reappear with lower dosages. The drug amantadine is sometimes of benefit for dyskinesias.&nbsp;Doctors                                          and indiiduals must work together closely to find a tolerable balance between the drug's benefits and side effects. If dyskinesias                                          are severe, surgical treatment may be considered. Because dyskinesias tend to occur with long-term use of levodopa, doctors                                          often start younger individuals with PD on other dopamine-increasing drugs and add levodopa later in the course of the disease.                                       </p>                                       <p>Other difficulties may be encountered later in the disease course. Patients may begin to notice more pronounced symptoms before                                          their first dose of medication in the morning and between doses as the period of effectiveness after each dose may begin to                                          shorten, called the <i>wearing-off effect</i>. People may also experience sudden, unpredictable &#8220;off periods,&#8221; where the medications do not seem to be working. One approach                                          to alleviating these side effects is to take levodopa more often and in smaller amounts.&nbsp; People with PD should never stop                                          taking levodopa without their physician's input, because rapidly withdrawing the drug can have potentially serious side effects.                                       </p>                                    </li>                                 </ul>                                 <p>In addition to levodopa-carbidopa, there are other available treatments:</p>                                 <ul>                                    <li>                                       <p><b>Dopamine agonists.</b>&nbsp;These drugs, which include apomorphine, pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine, mimic the role of dopamine in the brain.                                          They can be given alone or with levodopa. They are somewhat less effective than levodopa in treating PD symptoms.&nbsp;Many of                                          the potential side effects are similar to those associated with the use of levodopa, including drowsiness, sudden sleep onset,                                          hallucinations, confusion, dyskinesias, edema (swelling due to excess fluid in body tissues), nightmares, and vomiting.&nbsp;In                                          rare cases, they can cause an uncontrollable desire to gamble, hypersexuality, or compulsive shopping.                                       </p>                                    </li>                                    <li>                                       <p><b>MAO-B inhibitors</b>. These drugs inhibit the enzyme monoamine oxidase B, or MAO-B, which breaks down dopamine in the brain.&nbsp;MAO-B inhibitors                                          cause dopamine to accumulate in surviving nerve cells and reduce the symptoms of PD.&nbsp;Studies supported by the NINDS have shown                                          that selegiline (also called deprenyl) can delay the need for levodopa therapy by up to a year or more. When selegiline is                                          given with levodopa, it appears to enhance and prolong the response to levodopa and thus may reduce wearing-off.&nbsp; Selegiline                                          is usually well-tolerated, although side effects may include nausea, orthostatic hypotension, or insomnia.&nbsp;It should not be                                          taken with the antidepressant fluoxetine or the sedative meperidine, because combining selegiline with these drugs can be                                          harmful.&nbsp;Another MAO-B inhibitor, rasagiline, was approved by the FDA in May 2006 for use in treating the motor symptoms of                                          &nbsp;PD with our without levodopa.&nbsp; Study results announced in 2013 showed people with Parkinson&#8217;s disease &nbsp;who took rasagiline                                          as an add-on treatment to dopamine agonists showed a slower rate of disease worsening and less worsening between baselines                                          than in individuals who took a placebo.                                       </p>                                    </li>                                    <li>                                       <p><b>COMT inhibitors</b>.&nbsp;COMT stands for catechol-O-methyltransferase, another enzyme that breaks down dopamine.&nbsp;The drug entacapone and tolcapone                                          prolong the effects of levodopa by preventing the breakdown of dopamine.

<b>&nbsp;</b> Doctors may prescribe a variety of medications to treat the non-motor symptoms of PD, such as depression and anxiety.&nbsp;For                                    example, depression can be treated with standard antidepressant drugs such as amitriptyline or fluoxetine (however, as stated                                    earlier, fluoxetine should not be combined with MAO-B inhibitors).&nbsp;Anxiety can sometimes be treated with drugs called benzodiazepines.&nbsp;Orthostatic                                    hypotension may be helped by increasing salt intake, reducing antihypertension drugs, or prescribing medications such as fludrocortisone.&nbsp;                                 </p>                                 <p>Hallucinations, delusions, and other psychotic symptoms can be caused by the drugs prescribed for PD.&nbsp;Reducing PD medications                                    dosages or changing medications may be necessary if hallucinations occur.&nbsp;If such measures are not effective, doctors sometimes                                    prescribe drugs called atypical antipsychotics, which include clozapine and quetiapine.&nbsp;Clozapine also may help to control                                    dyskinesias.&nbsp; However, clozapine also can cause a serious blood disorder called agranulocytosis, so people who take it must                                    have their blood monitored frequently.                                 </p>                              </div>                           </topic_body><a

decades have led to                                    great improvements in surgical techniques, and surgery is again considered for people with PD for whom drug therapy is no                                    longer sufficient.                                 </p>                                 <p><b><i>Pallidotomy and Thalamotomy.&nbsp;</i></b> The earliest types of surgery for PD involved selectively destroying specific parts of the brain that contribute to PD symptoms.&nbsp;Surgical                                    techniques have been refined and can be very effective for the motor symptoms of PD.&nbsp;The most common lesion surgery is called                                    <i>pallidotomy.&nbsp;</i> In this procedure, a surgeon selectively destroys a portion of the brain called the globus pallidus.&nbsp;Pallidotomy can improve                                    symptoms of tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia, possibly by interrupting the connections between the globus pallidus and the                                    striatum or thalamus.&nbsp;Some studies have also found that pallidotomy can improve gait and balance and reduce the amount of                                    levodopa people require, thus reducing drug-induced dyskinesias.&nbsp;Another procedure, called <i>thalamotomy</i>, involves surgically destroying part of the thalamus; this approach is useful primarily to reduce tremor.                                 </p>                                 <p>Because these procedures cause permanent destruction of brain tissue, they have largely been replaced by <i>deep brain stimulation</i> for treatment of PD.                                 </p>                                 <p><b><i>Deep Brain Stimulation.</i></b> Deep brain stimulation, or DBS, uses an electrode surgically implanted into part of the brain, typically the subthalamic                                    nucleus or the globus pallidus.&nbsp;Similar to a cardiac pacemaker, a pulse generator (battery pack) that is implanted in the                                    chest area under the collarbone sends finely controlled electrical signals to the electrode(s) via a wire placed under the                                    skin. When turned on using an external wand, the pulse generator and electrodes painlessly stimulate the brain in a way that                                    helps to block signals that cause many of the motor symptoms of PD.&nbsp; DBS is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration                                    and is widely used as a treatment for PD.                                 </p>                                 <p>DBS can be used on one or both sides of the brain.&nbsp;If it is used on just one side, it will affect symptoms on the opposite                                    side of the body. &nbsp;DBS is primarily used to stimulate one of three brain regions:&nbsp;the subthalamic nucleus, the globus pallidus                                    interna, or the thalamus.&nbsp;However, the subthalamic nucleus, a tiny area located beneath the thalamus, is the most common target.&nbsp;Stimulation                                    of either the globus pallidus or the subthalamic nucleus can reduce tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity.&nbsp;Stimulation of the                                    thalamus is useful primarily for reducing tremor.                                 </p>                                 <p>People who initially responded well to treatment with levodopa tend to respond well to DBS.&nbsp;While the motor function benefits                                    of DBS can be substantial, it usually does not help with speech problems, "freezing," posture, balance, anxiety, depression,                                    or dementia.                                 </p>                                 <p>One advantage of DBS compared to pallidotomy and thalamotomy is that the electrical current can be turned off using a handheld                                    device.&nbsp;The pulse generator also can be externally programmed.                                 </p>                                 <p>Individuals must return to the medical center frequently for several months after DBS surgery in order to have the stimulation                                    adjusted by trained doctors or other medical professionals.&nbsp;The pulse generator must be programmed very carefully to give                                    the best results.&nbsp;Doctors also must supervise reductions in medications.&nbsp;After a few months, the number of medical visits                                    usually decreases significantly, though individuals may occasionally need to return to the center to have their stimulator                                    checked.&nbsp; Also, the battery for the pulse generator must be surgically replaced every three to five years, though externally                                    rechargeable batteries may eventually become available. DBS does not stop PD from progressing, and some problems may gradually                                    return.&nbsp;DBS is not a good option for everyone.&nbsp;It is generally appropriate for people with levodopa-responsive PD who have                                    developed dyskinesias or other disabling "off" symptoms despite drug therapy.&nbsp;It is not generally an option for people with                                    memory problems, hallucinations, severe depression, poor health, or a poor response to levodopa.&nbsp;DBS has not been demonstrated                                    to be of benefit for "atypical" parkinsonian syndromes such as multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, or                                    post-traumatic parkinsonism.                                 </p>                                 <p>As with any brain surgery, DBS has potential complications, including stroke or brain hemorrhage.&nbsp;These complications are                                    rare, however.&nbsp;There is also a risk of infection, which may require antibiotics or even replacement of parts of the DBS system.&nbsp;Researchers                                    are continuing to study DBS and to develop ways of improving it. A two-part study funded by the NINDS and the Department of                                    Veterans Affairs first compared bilateral DBS to best medical therapy, including medication adjustment and physical therapy.                                    &nbsp;Bilateral DBS showed overall superiority to best medical therapy at improving motor symptoms and quality of life. &nbsp;The second                                    part of the study, involving nearly 300 patients, compared subthalamic nucleus (STN) DBS to globus pallidus interna (GPI)                                    DBS.&nbsp; The two groups reported similar improvements in motor control and quality of life in scores on the Unified Parkinson&#8217;s                                    Disease Rating Scale.&nbsp;On a variety of neuropsychological tests, there were no significant differences between the two groups.&nbsp;However,                                    the STN DBS group experienced a greater decline on a test of visuomotor processing speed, which measures how quickly someone                                    thinks and acts on information. Also, the STN DBS group had slight worsening on a standard assessment of depression, while                                    the GPI DBS group had slight improvement on the same test. The importance of these two differences is not clear, and will                                    be scrutinized in follow-up research, the investigators say.&nbsp;Other clinical studies hope to determine the best part of the                                    brain to receive stimulation and to determine the long-term effects of this therapy. They also are working to improve the                                    technology used in DBS.                                 </p>                              </div>                           </topic_body><a name="267923159"></a><h3><i>Complementary and Supportive Therapies</i></h3><br><topic_body>                              <div xmlns:o="urn:www.microsoft.com/office" xmlns:st1="urn:www.microsoft.com/smarttags" xmlns:w="urn:www.microsoft.com/word" class="rxbodyfield">                                 <p>A wide variety of complementary and supportive therapies may be used for PD. Among these therapies are standard physical,                                    occupational, and speech therapy techniques, which can help with such problems as gait and voice disorders, tremors and rigidity,                                    and cognitive decline.&nbsp;Other types of supportive therapies include the following:                                 </p>                                 <p><b><i>Diet.</i></b> At this time there are no specific vitamins, minerals, or other nutrients that have any proven therapeutic value in PD. A                                    NINDS clinical study of the dietary supplement coenzyme Q10 was stopped in 2011 when results from an interim analysis showed                                    active treatment with the supplement was unlikely to demonstrate a statistically significant difference than from a placebo.&nbsp;The                                    NINDS and other components of the National Institutes of Health are funding research to determine if caffeine, antioxidants,                                    and other dietary factors may be beneficial for preventing or treating PD. While there is currently no proof that any specific                                    dietary factor is beneficial, a normal, healthy diet can promote overall well-being for people with PD just as it would for                                    anyone else. Eating a fiber-rich diet and drinking plenty of fluids also can help alleviate constipation.&nbsp;A high protein diet,                                    however, may limit levodopa's absorption, highlighting the importance of the timing of medications.                                 </p>                                 <p><b><i>Exercise.</i></b> Exercise can help people with PD improve their mobility and flexibility. Some doctors prescribe physical therapy or muscle-strengthening                                    exercises to tone muscles and to put underused and rigid muscles through a full range of motion. The effects of exercise on                                    disease progression are not known, but it &nbsp;may improve body strength so that the person is less disabled. Exercises also improve                                    balance, helping people minimize gait problems, and can strengthen certain muscles so that people can speak and swallow better.                                    &nbsp;Exercise can also improve the emotional well-being of people with PD, and more general physical activity, such as walking,                                    gardening, swimming, calisthenics, and using exercise machines, also is beneficial.&nbsp;People with PD should always check with                                    their doctors before beginning a new exercise program.                                 </p>                                 <p>Other complementary therapies that are used by some individuals with PD include massage therapy, yoga, tai chi, hypnosis,                                    acupuncture, and the Alexander technique, which optimizes posture and muscle activity.                                 </p>                                 <p>Another important therapeutic approach involves speech and swallowing evaluation and therapy.&nbsp;Certain techniques can help                                    with the low voice volume that patients with Parkinson&#8217;s often experience.                                 </p>                              </div>                           </topic_body><a name="267943159"></a><h2>How Can People Cope with Parkinson's Disease? </h2><br><topic_body>                              <div xmlns:o="urn:www.microsoft.com/office" xmlns:st1="urn:www.microsoft.com/smarttags" xmlns:w="urn:www.microsoft.com/word" class="rxbodyfield">                                 <p>While PD usually progresses slowly, eventually daily routines may be affected&#8212;from socializing with friends to earning a living                                    and taking care of a home.&nbsp;These changes can be difficult to accept.&nbsp;Support groups can help people cope with the disease                                    emotionally.&nbsp;These groups also can provide valuable information, advice, and experience to help people with PD, their families,                                    and their caregivers deal with a wide range of issues, including locating doctors familiar with the disease and coping with                                    physical limitations.
