Since the disease wasfirst recognised in 1975 it has become the most frequently reported human tick-borneinfection worldwide. It has been reported from every continent (except Antarctica)although doubt remains as to whether it occurs in the southern hemisphere in general, andin Australia in particular. </font></p><b><p><br><a name="ecology"></a><font face="Arial" size="4"><font color="#800000">Ecology</font></p></font></b><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">LD is transmitted to humans by ticks.Larval and nymphal stages feed on infected reservoir hosts, acquire the organism and then,after moulting to the next life stage (nymphs and adults respectively), pass on theinfection to humans and other animals. In the northern hemisphere, small placental mammalsare reservoir hosts. The only species of ticks shown to be competent vectors of <i>B.burgdorferi</i>to humans belong to the <i>Ixodes&nbsp;persulcatus</i> complex, including <i>I.&nbsp;scapularis</i>and <i>I.&nbsp;pacificus</i> in the United States, <i>I.&nbsp;ricinus</i> in westernEurope, and <i>I.&nbsp;persulcatus</i> in eastern Europe and Asia. No species of thiscomplex exist in Australia. </font></p><p><br><a name="clinical"></a><font face="Arial" size="4"><b><font color="#800000">ClinicalFeatures</font></p></b></font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The epithet &quot;The Great Imitator&quot;is now used for LD as it was once for another major spirochaetal disease, syphilis. Likesyphilis, LD causes a wide range of (mostly) non-specific symptoms and signs; there are 3clinical stages: </font></p><dl>  <font face="Arial" size="3">  <dt><strong>Stage I:</strong></dt>  <dd><p align="JUSTIFY">Manifestations include fever, fatigue, headaches, myalgia, arthralgia    (but not arthritis) and lymphadenopathy, usually within 2-3 weeks of infection. A    characteristic skin lesion, erythema migrans (EM), appears 3-30 days after the bite of an    infected tick, usually at the site of inoculation. The initial lesion is a red    maculo-papular lesion greater than 5cm in diameter, rarely painful and expands and may    reach more than 50cm in diameter, with central clearing and a well defined, circinate    border (&quot;bulls-eye&quot;). Multiple lesions at different stages of evolution may be    present. Allergic reactions, associated with tick bites, may be confused with early EM,    but occur within a few hours of the bite and resolve within a few days. In North America,    EM occurs in 60-80% of serologically confirmed cases of LD. </font></p>  </dd>  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>  <font face="Arial" size="3">  <dt><strong>Stage II:</strong></dt>  <dd><p align="JUSTIFY">Symptoms are non-specific and occur weeks or months after the tick    bite. A causative association with LD is often uncertain. The lesions resemble those of    secondary syphilis: carditis, chronic meningitis, mononeuritis (eg Bell's palsy) and    conjunctivitis. Arthralgia and myalgia are often prominent. </font></p>  </dd>  <dt>&nbsp;</dt>  <font face="Arial" size="3">  <dt><strong>Stage III:</strong></dt>  <dd><p align="JUSTIFY">Symptoms occur months or years after exposure. The most typical    feature, North American, is an erosive arthritis of large joints, particularly the knees.    A chronic skin manifestation, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (ACA) occurs, mainly in    European patients. </font></p>  </dd></dl><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Recently, four genospecies of <i>B.burgdorferi</i>have been described; <i>B. burgdorferi sensu stricto,</i> <i>B. garinii</i>, <i>B. afzelii</i>and <i>B. japonica. </i>They are associated with different patterns of disease, any ofwhich can mimic other diseases. With the possible exceptions of typical EM and ACAassociated with appropriate exposure, clinical features alone are insufficient fordiagnosis of LD and laboratory tests are required for confirmation. </font></p><font face="Arial" size="4"><b><p><br><a name="diag"></a><font color="#800000">Diagnosis</font></b></font></p><i><p><font face="Arial" size="4" color="#800000">Culture/PCR</font></i></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Isolation of the causative organism from apunch biopsy taken at the edge of the EM lesion is successful in up to 80% of cases but itmay be up to 8 weeks before spirochaetes can be detected. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)has the advantage of greater sensitivity and speed; a result is available within 24 hours.Isolation and/or PCR should be attempted upon presentation of a patient with an EM lesion.</font></p><font face="Arial" size="4"><i><p><a name="serol"></a><font color="#800000">Serology</font></i></font></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Laboratory diagnosis of late LD (Stage II&amp; III) is less reliable and depends on serological tests including the indirectfluorescence antibody test (IFAT), enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and Westernimmunoblot (WB). False positive results occur due to cross reactions with other bacteria,especially other spirochaetes, viruses and in unrelated syndromes such as autoimmunediseases. IFAT and ELISA are used as screening tests but there has been littlestandardisation of methods. </font></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Any borderline or positive results shouldbe confirmed by WB which can detect protein bands specific for <i>B. burgdorferi. </i>However,nonspecific bands occur, particularly with the highly cross reactive 41kDa (flagellin)protein. At the Sixth International Congress on Lyme Borreliosis a standardisedinterpretation of WB results was accepted: an IgG immunoblot is considered positive if 5of the following 10 bands are present: 18, 21, 28, 30, 39, 41, 45, 58, 66 and 93kDa.Patients with late stage LD will show 10 or more bands on a WB. </font></p><b><font face="Arial" size="4"><p><br><a name="treat"></a><font color="#800000">Treatment</font></font></b></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The antibiotic therapy of early LDgenerally results in complete recovery. A 2 week course of oral doxycycline or amoxycillinfor Stage I and a third generation cephalosporin for Stage II are the most commonly usedregimens. Treatment of late stage LD is less successful and a chronic or relapsing courseis common. A third generation cephalosporin for 3 weeks is recommended. </font></p><p><br><a name="prevent"></a><font face="Arial" size="4"><b><font color="#800000">Prevention</font></p></b></font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The prevention of LD is mainly throughavoidance of tick infested areas and of tick bites by the use of <ahref="../photos/mosquito%20photos.htm#repell">repellents</a> (particularly thosecontaining DEET), wearing of light coloured clothing so that ticks are more easily seenand prompt removal of attached ticks. Transmission of spirochaetes generally does notoccur until after 24 hours attachment of the tick. Antibiotic prophylaxis is notrecommended. Trials of LD vaccines are in progress with varying degrees of success. </font></p><p><b><font face="Arial" size="4">&nbsp;</p></font><p><font face="Arial Black" size="4">LYME DISEASE IN AUSTRALIA</font></p><font face="Arial" size="4"><p><a name="history"></a><font color="#800000">History - Australia</font></font></b></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The first Australian cases of a syndromeconsistent with Lyme disease were reported from the Hunter Valley region of New SouthWales in 1982. Serology was initially negative on one of the 6 patients, but laterreported as positive in low titre. Cases of EM with febrile illness were reported in 1986from the south and central coasts of New South Wales. All had negative serology. InQueensland, from 1986 to 1989, the State Health Laboratories tested 1,247 patients for <i>B.burgdorferi</i>antibody using an IFAT and reported 186 (15%) positive (titre 64) titres. In none of thesecases was confirmatory serology (WB) undertaken. </font></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In 1988 at Westmead Hospital, amultidisciplinary investigation of putative LD in coastal New South Wales began,encompassing clinical, serological, vector and reservoir host studies.</font><fontFACE="Arial"> <br>&nbsp;</p></font><font face="Arial" size="4"><b><p><a name="austclin"></a><font color="#800000">Clinical investigations</b> <b>- Australia</b></font></font></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Over the past 6 years, due principally tolocal publicity, there has been an increase in serological testing for LD. This is ofteninitiated by patients, who believe that LD may be an explanation for an undiagnosed healthproblem. Thus, most patients seen by infectious diseases specialists are self selected andreferred for assessment on the basis of tick exposure and reported positive screeningserology. </font></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Patients frequently have long-standingsymptoms for which no other diagnosis has been established including myalgia, arthralgiawithout objective evidence of joint disease, neurological symptoms such as frequentheadaches, inability to concentrate and impairment of memory, and syndromes resemblingchronic fatigue syndrome. The late LD dermatological manifestation, ACA, has not beenreported in Australia. </font></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">A few cases of EM have been reported fromSouth-Eastern Australia. However, diagnosis can be confounded by a spectacularerythematous hypersensitivity reaction to the bite of <i>I. holocyclus</i>, the mostcommon tick biting humans in New South Wales. Of eight skin biopsies submitted to WestmeadHospital for spirochaete isolation, one, from a patient returning from a LD endemic areain Europe, was culture positive for <i>B.burgdorferi</i>.

The overallseropositive rate was 2.2% (9/400). The seroprevalence in New South Wales is comparablewith that in non-LD areas, where 1-3% of human sera are seropositive due to cross reactingantibodies and contrasts with reports from known endemic areas, outside Australia, whererural populations have considerably higher seropositive rates. A serosurvey of dogs in NewSouth Wales showed a similar result with 2.5% (6/239) seropositive and another fromBrisbane also showed no evidence of <i>B.burgdorferi</i> infection. These suggest thatsoutheastern Australia is a non-endemic area. </font></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">From 1988 to 1994 at Westmead Hospital, 78(1.8%) of 4,372 from local patients with suspected LD were positive for IgG by ELISA andIFAT. All 78 were tested by WB, using North American and European strains of <i>Borrelia</i>;46 sera showed one or more bands. None, including those with putative late stage disease,showed more than 4 specific bands and thus were all negative by international criteria.Twenty-four patients with various bacterial, viral or autoimmune syndromes unrelated to LDwere tested in parallel and 11/24 showed one or 2 indicative bands. Thus a high degree ofcross reactivity was demonstrated with non-LD patients. </font></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">Recently, there have been reports fromeastern Australia of LD-like illness associated with WB serology yielding bands at 31kDa(OspA) and the highly-cross reactive 41kDa band. None of these results conforms withinternationally accepted criteria for a positive WB. Concomitant with this are results ofWB analysis of sera from patients with syndromes unrelated to LD, &gt;30% of which reactedwith a 41kDa band and &gt;10% with the OspA band. </font></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">The sensitivity of serological testing forLD sometimes depends on the strain of <i>Borrelia </i>used and could confoundinterpretation of results in Australia, where no local spirochaete has been isolated foruse as a reference antigen. </font></p><p><font FACE="Arial" SIZE="4"><b><br><a name="austinve"></a><font color="#800000">Vector and Reservoir Host Investigations -Australia</font></p></b></font><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">To detect a possible causative agent, tickswere collected from areas associated with putative infections and examined forspirochaetes by dark field microscopy, culture of gut contents, and direct testing ofticks with PCR for the <i>Borrelia</i>-specific flagellin gene. </font></p><p align="JUSTIFY"><font face="Arial" size="3">In total, over 12,000 ticks were testedincluding &gt;1,000 by PCR.

Electronmicrographs were similar to those of SLOs recovered from contaminated cultures from ticksin Missouri, USA and were composed of aggregations of bacterial flagella, thought tooriginate from the contaminants. Molecular characterisation indicated that the SLOs sharedsome antigens with <i>B.burgdorferi</i>, but were not genetically related.
