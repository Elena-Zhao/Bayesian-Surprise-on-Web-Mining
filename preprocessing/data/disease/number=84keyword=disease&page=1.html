Some patients experience acute (severe) rotational vertigo (a form of dizziness) &quot;attacks&quot; very frequently; other patients experience acute rotational vertigo attacks less frequently, or experience less severe attacks. Some patients lose hearing at a rapid rate and become deafened in the affected ear quickly; other patients lose hearing much more slowly, some so slowly that they never become totally deafened during their lifetimes. Some patients experience some degree of episodic, fluctuating tinnitus &quot;24/7,&quot; while other patients experience episodic tinnitus that fluctuates from zero to a roar. The variations of tinnitus are endless. For some patients, tinnitus is the sound of a zillion crickets chirping; for other patients, tinnitus is the sound of a jet engine whine; for still other patients, a &quot;thumping&quot; sound; for even other patients, a cacophony of sounds. Some patients experience episodic, fluctuating aural fullness that can become acute, sometimes even to the point of ear pain (although ear pain is unrecognized as a symptom in the authoritative literature); other patients experience lesser degrees of episodic, fluctuating aural fullness. The majority of patients are unilateral, having Meniere's Disease in &quot;just&quot; one ear; other patients are, or will become, bilateral -- having Meniere's Disease in both ears. </font></p><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#000000">There are two &quot;atypical&quot; forms of Meniere's Disease, in which there are three (rather than four) symptoms.&nbsp;&quot;Atypical&quot; is one word, where the initial letter &quot;a&quot; means &quot;not.&quot;&nbsp; Therefore, &quot;atypical&quot; means &quot;not typical.&quot;&nbsp; One &quot;atypical&quot; form is &quot;cochlear Meniere's Disease&quot; (also called &quot;cochlear hydrops&quot;), the symptoms of which are (1) episodic, fluctuating hearing loss, (2) episodic, fluctuating tinnitus, and (3) episodic, fluctuating aural fullness; there is no episodic, fluctuating rotational vertigo (dizziness) in this &quot;atypical&quot; form of Meniere's Disease.&nbsp; The other &quot;atypical&quot; form is &quot;vestibular Meniere's Disease&quot; (also called &quot;vestibular hydrops&quot;), the symptoms of which are (1) episodic, fluctuating rotational vertigo, (2) episodic, fluctuating tinnitus, and (3) episodic, fluctuating aural fullness; there is no episodic, fluctuating hearing loss in this &quot;atypical&quot; form of Meniere's Disease.&nbsp; Some, but not all, patients who start out with atypical Meniere's Disease sooner or later develop the remaining fourth symptom and thus develop &quot;classic&quot; Meniere's Disease.</font></p><center><ul><li><p align="left"><font size="2"><b>This is a brief summary.&nbsp; <a href="symptoms.html">Click here for extensive information on the symptoms of Meniere's Disease, linked to authoritative sources.</a>&nbsp;<br></b></font></li></ul></center></blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="90%" bgcolor="#808080"><tr><td width="100%"><b>&nbsp;<a name="cause"></a>What is the cause of Meniere's Disease? <a href="#cause"><img border="0" src="direct-link.jpg" align="absbottom" width="96" height="13"></a></b></td></tr></table><blockquote><ul><li><p align="left"><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Arial"><b>Fact: Meniere's Disease is &quot;idiopathic&quot; -- the cause is unknown.</b></font></li></ul><p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Arial">Some doctors have their own opinions as to the cause of Meniere's Disease, but &quot;opinions&quot; are not &quot;facts.&quot; Most researchers believe that the symptoms that are called Meniere's Disease in most (but not all) patients are the result of &quot;idiopathic endolymphatic hydrops&quot; -- excess endolymphatic fluid (one of two inner ear fluids) from an unknown (&quot;idiopathic&quot;) cause.&nbsp; Under this theory, acute attacks occur when excess potassium-rich endolymphatic fluid leaks through a separating membrane into sodium-rich perilymphatic fluid (the other inner ear fluid), contaminating it.</font></p><p align="left"><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Arial">&quot;Idiopathic endolymphatic hydrops&quot; is sometimes simplified in conversation to &quot;endolymphatic hydrops,&quot; or simply &quot;hydrops&quot;&nbsp;(although there are many types of &quot;hydrops&quot;). Some cases of endolymphatic hydrops occur from known causes, and are therefore neither &quot;idiopathic endolymphatic hydrops,&quot; nor &quot;Meniere's Disease.&quot;&nbsp; (In other words, if you know what is causing your symptoms, then, by definition, you do not have Meniere's Disease.)&nbsp;</font></p><p align="left"><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Arial">In any event, endolymphatic hydrops (whether idiopathic (Meniere's Disease) or otherwise) can only be confirmed by autopsy. Prior to autopsy, a diagnosis of endolymphatic hydrops is educated speculation based upon the fact that there is no other identifiable cause for the symptoms and from inferences drawn from test results that are &quot;pointers&quot; rather than &quot;litmus test&quot;&nbsp;results.&nbsp; Of the small number of patients diagnosed with Meniere's Disease who eventually have autopsies, some are found to *not* have endolymphatic hydrops.</font></p><p align="left"><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Arial">Some researchers believe that in some patients with &quot;Meniere's Disease,&quot; the symptoms are the result of a blood vessel pressing upon a nerve (&quot;microvascular compression syndrome&quot; (MCS) (also called &quot;vascular compression&quot; and &quot;neurovascular compression&quot;)); other researchers view this as a separate disease.&nbsp; Some researchers believe that in some patients with &quot;Meniere's Disease,&quot; the symptoms result from some autoimmune condition. Still others believe that in some patients with &quot;Meniere's Disease&quot; the symptoms are the result of a virus infection, but studies have yet to confirm this.&nbsp; There are a very few studies that find a possible connection with the herpes simplex virus (HSV).&nbsp; The authors of these studies do not claim that Meniere's Disease is *caused* by HSV, but conclude that their results show that more study is needed to determine whether HSV has any effect on the symptoms that we call &quot;Meniere's Disease.&quot;&nbsp; (Click <a href="research.html"><b>here</b></a> to conduct research on HSV and Meniere's Disease, and other topics.)&nbsp; <u>The bottom line:&nbsp; no one knows what causes Meniere's Disease</u>.</font></p><p align="left">      <font size="2">      <font face="Arial">Meniere's Disease cannot</font><font face="Arial" size="2"> be traced genetically; it is not hereditary and it is not       inherited.&nbsp; However, the incidence is slightly higher in <i>some</i> families for reasons not understood; thus, Meniere's Disease is sometimes said to be &quot;familial.&quot;</font> </font></p><p align="left"><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Arial">Our lay and inexpert speculation: perhaps there are ten (or more or fewer) currently unknown diseases that each have the same symptoms as what we now call &quot;Meniere's Disease,&quot; and we each have one (or perhaps two or three) of the ten (or more or fewer) of the currently unknown diseases. *IF* this is true, then ten patients could be diagnosed with &quot;Meniere's Disease,&quot; yet each one could have a different disease, and each one could respond differently to various treatments.</font></p><ul><li><p align="left"><font size="2"><b>This is a brief summary.&nbsp; <a href="cause.html">Click here for extensive information on possible origins and causes, linked to authoritative sources.</a></b></font></li></ul></blockquote><table border="0" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="90%" bgcolor="#808080"><tr><td width="100%"><font color="#000000"><b><font size="2" color="#000000"><a name="diagnosis"></a></font></b></font><b>How is Meniere's Disease diagnosed?&nbsp; <a href="#diagnosis"><img border="0" src="direct-link.jpg" align="absbottom" width="96" height="13"></a></b></td></tr></table><blockquote><ul><li><p align="left"><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#000000"><b>Fact:&nbsp; There are many diseases and conditions that have the same symptoms as Meniere's Disease</b>.</font> </li><li><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#000000"><b>Fact:&nbsp; There is no definitive test for Meniere's Disease.</b></font></li></ul><div align="center"><center><table border="3" cellpadding="5" cellspacing="5" style="border-collapse: collapse" width="60%" bordercolor="#000000"><tr><td width="100%"><font color="#000000"><b><font size="2" color="#000000">CAUTION:&nbsp; It is not possible to self-diagnose Meniere's Disease.&nbsp; Meniere's Disease is *not* defined by its symptoms.&nbsp; There are many disorders that have the same symptoms as Meniere's Disease.&nbsp; A differential diagnosis with diagnostic tests is required.&nbsp; For a diagnosis, you *must* see a licensed and qualified medical professional.</font></b></font><b><font color="#000000"><font size="2" color="#000000">&nbsp; </font><font size="2">See the <a href="#diagnosis">diagnosis information below</a> and our <a href="diagnosis.html">diagnosis</a> page for further information.</font></font></b></td></tr></table></center></div><p><font size="2" face="Arial" color="#000000">There are many diseases and conditions that have the same symptoms as Meniere's Disease; these diseases and conditions are said to be &quot;mimics&quot; of Meniere's Disease.&nbsp; Therefore, Meniere's Disease cannot be diagnosed just by its symptoms.&nbsp; The various possibilities have to be &quot;differentiated&quot; by a &quot;differential diagnosis.&quot;&nbsp; A differential diagnosis of Meniere's Disease is a diagnosis of &quot;exclusion.&quot; (A process of elimination.)&nbsp;&nbsp;When doctors &quot;exclude&quot; (rule out through testing) all other possible diseases with the same symptoms, they call the condition &quot;Meniere's Disease.&quot;&nbsp; Thus, a diagnosis of Meniere's Disease is tantamount to saying, &quot;we know what your symptoms are, but we don't know what is causing them.&quot;&nbsp; In other words, there is no known &quot;disease&quot; called &quot;Meniere's Disease.&quot;&nbsp; Meniere's Disease is sometimes referred to as &quot;Meniere's Syndrome,&quot; where a &quot;syndrome&quot; is a collection of symptoms.
