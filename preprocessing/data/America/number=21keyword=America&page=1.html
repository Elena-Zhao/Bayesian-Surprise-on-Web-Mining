It started as a small pledge, written for a Christian, children's magazine that was trying to sell American flags. This was back in 1892, when they were celebrating the 400 year anniversary of the day Columbus arrived on American shores. The magazine had contracted a Baptist minister, Francis Bellamy, to write it. He wrote: "I pledge allegiance to my flag, and to the republic for which it stands: one nation indivisible, with liberty and justice for all." President Benjamin Harrison is credited with making it a part of the public school morning ritual less than a year after it was first written. He proclaimed that children were to recite it during their observance of Columbus day on October 12, 1892. As stated, the original words of the Pledge of Allegiance weren't quite the same as what Americans recite today. The pledge evolved in parts and pieces starting in 1923, when the National Flag Conference (a conference that would discuss and recommend certain procedures for dealing with the US flag to legislatures) recommended several changes. The first recommendation was to change the words 'my flag' to 'the flag of the United States'. A year later, they added 'of America'. It wasn't adopted as the national pledge by congress until December 28, 1945. In 1954, President Eisenhower signed a bill to add the words "under God" just after "one nation". Eisenhower had recommended the change to congress after hearing a sermon in a Presbyterian church. Rev. Dr. George Docherty is the one who had delivered the sermon, and was even quoted when congressman Charles Oakman spoke to the house, urging them to pass the bill. He even ended his speech with, "Mr. Speaker, I think Mr. Docherty hit the nail square on the head."<BR><BR><BR>--><!--cmto; I pledge allegiance to the earth and to the flora, fauna and human life that it supports, one planet indivisible, with safe air, water & soil, economic justice, equal rights and peace for all. ~Author unknown, proposed new Pledge of Allegiance, as seen on a button at evolvefish.com<BR><BR><BR>-->America is an enormous frosted cupcake in the middle of millions of starving people. ~Gloria Steinem<BR><BR><BR>The trouble with America is that there are far too many wide-open spaces surrounded by teeth. ~Charles Luckman<!--1ww--><BR><BR><BR>America is a place where Jewish merchants sell Zen love beads to agnostics for Christmas. ~John Burton Brimer<BR><BR><BR>The metaphor of the melting pot is unfortunate and misleading.
