Rameez Moosa and Siddhant Nirula live literally a block away from each other in Toronto and made the journey to NYC\/NJ together. And we have yet another Baker from Richmond, VA today. The man between the sticks for the Arsenal America 5 v 5 Champs, Andy.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>1. There were lots of events going on leading up to the game itself. What were you looking forward to the most and what was your favorite part of the whole experience?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>RM<\/strong>: I was mostly looking forward to the event at the IZOD center which was a great experience to see some of the players up close. The questions asked to the players was a good experience as well.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>SN<\/strong>: The match itself was the biggest event and that is what I was looking most forward to, just the dream of watching Arsenal play come to fruition was surreal. I didn't know what to say for 15 minutes, I can't believe how lucky I am that I have got to experience how it is on match day. The Arsenal fans definitely made this whole event memorable. Our fan base is just sensational.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"\/arsenalamerica2014\/uploads\/pic 1.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Speaking of the fan base, something tells me Sidd (right) quite enjoyed this gentleman's T-shirt. I wonder why...<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>AB<\/strong>: The obvious answer to this is the game but I was all about getting my picture taken with the FA Cup Friday because let&rsquo;s be honest, how often do you get that opportunity! My favorite part of the entire weekend though was the last event put on, the 5 v 5 tournament at Chelsea Piers. I had heard that it was a nice facility and was very impressed when I showed up. I was the keeper for our Richmond Gooners team and we ended up going undefeated, winning the entire tournament! The only bad thing about the tournament was that I forgot my keeper gloves at home since I was very excited about the trip and I had to drive home 7 hours with bruises all over my hands (and they still hurt 3 days later)!<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"\/arsenalamerica2014\/uploads\/pic 2.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Andy looking rather surprised after his team were crowned undefeated Champions (Invincibles inspired perhaps?)<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>2. Did you happen to acquire any merchandise\/memorabilia from any of the events (new kits, boots, autographs or anything else of the kind)?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>RM<\/strong>: I bought the new Arsenal home kit and pair of the new Arsenal edition of the Puma cleats (EvoSpeed 4). I also got an autograph from Rambo on one of my last year jerseys. It felt amazing getting his autograph!<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"\/arsenalamerica2014\/uploads\/pic 3.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Rameez's 2014 away shirt signed by Rambo himself. How he got it is quite the story too!<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>SN<\/strong>: Nah, well Zelalem&rsquo;s autograph, could have got Gibbs autograph but yeah well, that&rsquo;s another story lol. Other than that, the Arsenal caps given out at the IZOD Center.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"\/arsenalamerica2014\/uploads\/pic 4.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Sidd (right) sporting that cap he got from the Izod Center Fan Party in a shot with the FA Cup (and me, again!)<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>AB<\/strong>: For winning the 5 v 5 tournament, Puma &amp; Arsenal America gave us the real authentic home kit which was fantastic since we weren't really expecting anything!!<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>3. Have you gotten your hands on the new Arsenal kit? What do you think about the new design?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>RM<\/strong>: I bought the new home kit and I think it is a really nice one. Love the design, and specially the feel of the logo.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"\/arsenalamerica2014\/uploads\/pic 5.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>Rameez (left, obviously) in the new home kit posing after being interviewed by Robbie from AFTV!<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>SN<\/strong>: The design is amazing, the kit looks really good and will be buying it very soon. It&rsquo;s quite a change from the Nike ones, which I feel is brilliant for Arsenal and the fans! Different designs to love.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>AB<\/strong>: Yes and I like the changes. Since I have the authentic kit it&rsquo;s really interesting seeing the technology on the inside of the shirt and reading about how it is supposed to work. I am really looking forward to the 3rd kit being released since I really like that design.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>4. Have you watched The Arsenal play before this event?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>RM<\/strong>: This was my first experience of watching Arsenal live and it was epic! Can&rsquo;t wait to see them at the Emirates one day.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>SN<\/strong>: Unfortunately not.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>AB<\/strong>: New York was my first ever Arsenal match in person.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>5. How long have you been supporting the club and what has been your favorite moment as a fan?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>RM<\/strong>: I started supporting Arsenal right after the FA Cup victory back in 2005. So my favorite moment has to be the FA Cup win over Hull City in the 13\/14 season, since it was the first trophy for me as an Arsenal fan.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>SN<\/strong>: Since 2002 and my favorite moment has to be the 2-1 victory over Barcelona, the crowd that day was electric. It was such a good feeling to beat Barcelona.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>AB<\/strong>: I've been a die hard for about 5 years now, but since my best friend followed them for longer I was very familiar with the Arsenal. My favorite moment was Ramsey scoring the goal that won the FA Cup in May. My best friend and I were away from Richmond waiting for a friend&rsquo;s wedding later on that Saturday in Cape Hatteras, NC. There were no bars anywhere within 50 miles so we had to resort to 120 minutes of football on a 13 inch tube TV in our room. When Ramsey hit that goal we went absolutely bonkers and I don&rsquo;t know if I&rsquo;ll ever be able to experience a win like that ever again!!<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>6. (Sort of) Mandatory question: Who&rsquo;s your favorite Arsenal player, past and\/or present?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>RM<\/strong>: My favorite present player has to be Aaron Ramsey without a slight doubt. And from the past, definitely The King.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>SN<\/strong>: Thierry Henry, well Gibran, you know this by now lol (Oh I'm aware, Sidd. I&rsquo;m aware.)<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>AB<\/strong>: Steve Bould. I own a Steve Bould &rsquo;91 kit and wish I could have got him to sign it. He seems like an awesome guy and has been a faithful Gooner for a long time&hellip;so I&rsquo;m going to be the guy to give him his praise!<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><img src=\"\/arsenalamerica2014\/uploads\/pic 6.jpg\" alt=\"\" \/><\/p>\r\n<p>(L-R) Keith, Kyle (in Part 1 of this series!) and Andy (in his '91 Bould shirt) out and about in Chinatown, NYC.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>7. A little something for the future: What do you make of our summer signings and who else would you like to see signed by the club? What are your expectations from the coming season?<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>RM<\/strong>: We have made some amazing signings! Sanchez is a very good one. Walcott and Sanchez on our wings will scare the opposition every game. Chambers is very versatile so that&rsquo;s a good signing as well. Just hoping to get another DM and we should be able to win the league. My minimum expectation for the next season is the league for sure. Beyond that, I wouldn`t mind a double or even a treble ;)<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>SN<\/strong>: I am very happy with the signings so far and looking forward to the coming season, I expect another trophy to be honest, if all clicks, considering now we do have some depth, quality wise too, I am expecting some big things now. I would like Schneiderlin or Khedira to be signed, although, any defensive midfielder who will be an upgrade to the current will be a bonus. Another attacker wouldn't be an issue either.<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>AB<\/strong>: I think it&rsquo;s kind of nice that we've signed some top quality players before training began but with our players success in the World Cup I&rsquo;m afraid we might have a bit of a slower start to the season than we would generally hope for. It baffles me that even after signing 4 top guys we are still at the center of the transfer market rumor mill! As far as expectations next season we need to keep collecting trophies. We have momentum heading into this season with the FA Cup and we have to keep moving in the right direction. I would like to see us progress a bit further in the Champions League this upcoming season. We have the quality to do it and we just need to play our game and win!<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Before we wrap up part 2, just a couple of quick mentions. First of all, Andy saying his favorite player is Steve Bould was quite possibly the most unique response to a 'who's your favorite player' type of question. Bould has always been a colossal (literally) asset for us, so it&rsquo;s lovely to see him being picked out as a favorite. Cheers to that, Andy!<\/p>\r\n<p>Also, a very special shout out to Rameez and Siddhant who happened to be my roommates for the trip. We've known each other (via social media) for a while now but never quite had the opportunity to meet. So it was fantastic to finally meet you lads!<\/p>\r\n<p>Part 3 coming your way soon! Until next time.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Gibran Chadha<\/p>\r\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/shadyarteta\">https:\/\/twitter.com\/shadyarteta<\/a><br \/><a href=\"http:\/\/goonwiththewind.blogspot.com\/\">http:\/\/goonwiththewind.blogspot.com\/<br \/><\/a><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>"}]}};if(template_dir===undefined){ var template_dir = 'templates/' }	if(!loaded){						T.fetch(template_dir+'core/nav');						T.fetch(template_dir+'core/header');						T.fetch(template_dir+'core/footer');						Handlebars.registerPartial("header", 	T.cached[template_dir+'core/header']);						Handlebars.registerPartial("footer", 	T.cached[template_dir+'core/footer']);						Handlebars.registerPartial("nav", 	T.cached[template_dir+'core/nav']);						if(appData){							T.render(template_dir+'core/header', function(t) { $('body').html( t(appData) ); });						}					}</script><script>  sendTo('index','');</script>
