Its principal ranges are the Tien Shan, the Kunlun chain, and the    Trans-Himalaya. In the southwest is Tibet, which China annexed in 1950.    The Gobi Desert lies to the north. China proper consists of three great    river systems: the Yellow River (Huang He), 2,109 mi (5,464 km) long; the    Yangtze River (Chang Jiang), the third-longest river in the world at 2,432    mi (6,300 km); and the Pearl River (Zhu Jiang), 848 mi (2,197 km)    long.</p>    <h1 class="level3" id="Government">Government</h1>    <p style="font-size:13px">Communist state.</p>    <h1 class="level3" id="History">History</h1>    <p style="font-size:13px">The earliest recorded human settlements in what    is today called China were discovered in the Huang He basin and date from    about 5000 <span class="small">B.C.</span> During the Shang dynasty    (1500&ndash;1000 <span class="small">B.C.</span>), the precursor of modern    China's ideographic writing system developed, allowing the emerging feudal    states of the era to achieve an advanced stage of civilization, rivaling    in sophistication any society found at the time in Europe, the Middle    East, or the Americas. It was following this initial flourishing of    civilization, in a period known as the Chou dynasty (1122&ndash;249 <span    class="small">B.C.</span>), that Lao-tse, Confucius, Mo Ti, and Mencius    laid the foundation of Chinese philosophical thought.</p>    <p style="font-size:13px">The feudal states, often at war with one    another, were first united under Emperor Ch'in Shih Huang Ti, during whose    reign (246&ndash;210 <span class="small">B.C.</span>) work was begun on    the Great Wall of China, a monumental bulwark against invasion from the    West. Although the Great Wall symbolized China's desire to protect itself    from the outside world, under the Han dynasty (206 <span    class="small">B.C.&ndash;A.D.</span> 220), the civilization conducted    extensive commercial trading with the West.</p>    <p style="font-size:13px">In the T'ang dynasty (618&ndash;907)&mdash;often    called the golden age of Chinese history&mdash;painting, sculpture, and    poetry flourished, and woodblock printing, which enabled the mass    production of books, made its earliest known appearance. The Mings, last    of the native rulers (1368&ndash;1644), overthrew the Mongol, or Yuan,    dynasty (1271&ndash;1368) established by Kublai Khan. The Mings in turn    were overthrown in 1644 by invaders from the north, the Manchus.</p>    <h5 class="pagebreak"><b>War Losses Cause China to Sign Away Sovereignty</b></h5>    <p style="font-size:13px">China remained largely isolated from the rest of    the world's civilizations, closely restricting foreign activities. By the    end of the 18th century only Canton (location of modern-day Hong Kong) and    the Portuguese port of Macao were open to European merchants. But with the    first Anglo-Chinese War in 1839&ndash;1842, a long period of instability    and concessions to Western colonial powers began. Following the war,    several ports were opened up for trading, and Hong Kong was ceded to    Britain. Treaties signed after further hostilities (1856&ndash;1860)    weakened Chinese sovereignty and gave foreigners immunity from Chinese    jurisdiction. European powers took advantage of the disastrous    Sino-Japanese War of 1894&ndash;1895 to gain further trading concessions    from China. Peking's response, the Boxer Rebellion (1900), was suppressed    by an international force.</p>    <p style="font-size:13px">The death of Empress Dowager Tzu Hsi in 1908 and    the accession of the infant emperor Hs&uuml;an T'ung (Pu-Yi) were followed    by a nationwide rebellion led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, who overthrew the    Manchus and became the first president of the Provisional Chinese Republic    in 1911. Dr. Sun resigned in favor of Yuan Shih-k'ai, who suppressed the    Republicans in a bid to consolidate his power. Yuan's death in June 1916    was followed by years of civil war between rival militarists and Dr. Sun's    Republicans. Nationalist forces, led by General Chiang Kai-shek and with    the advice of Communist experts, soon occupied most of China, setting up    the Kuomintang regime in 1928. Internal strife continued, however, and    Chiang eventually broke with the Communists.</p>    <p style="font-size:13px">On Sept. 18, 1931, Japan launched an invasion of    Manchuria, capturing the province. Tokyo set up a puppet state dubbed    Manchukuo and installed the last Manchu emperor, Henry Pu-Yi (Hs&uuml;an    T'ung), as its nominal leader. Japanese troops moved to seize China's    northern provinces in July 1937 but were resisted by Chiang, who had been    able to use the Japanese invasion to unite most of China behind him.    Within two years, however, Japan had seized most of the nation's eastern    ports and railways. The Kuomintang government retreated first to Hankow    and then to Chungking, while the Japanese set up a puppet government at    Nanking, headed by Wang Jingwei.</p>    <h5 class="pagebreak"><b>People's Republic of China Is Established</b></h5>    <p style="font-size:13px">Japan's surrender to the Western Allies in 1945    touched off civil war between the Kuomintang forces under Chiang and    Communists led by Mao Zedong, who had been battling since the 1930s for    control of China. Despite U.S. aid, the Kuomintang were overcome by the    Soviet-supported Communists, and Chiang and his followers were forced to    flee the mainland, establishing a government-in-exile on the island of    Formosa (Taiwan). The Mao regime proclaimed the People's Republic of China    on Oct. 1, 1949, with Beijing as the new capital and Zhou Enlai as    premier.</p>    <p style="font-size:13px">After the Korean War began in June 1950, China    led the Communist bloc in supporting North Korea, and on Nov. 26, 1950,    the Mao regime sent troops to assist the North in its efforts to capture    the South.</p>    <p style="font-size:13px">In an attempt to restructure China's primarily    agrarian economy, Mao undertook the &ldquo;Great Leap Forward&rdquo;    campaign in 1958, a disastrous program that aimed to combine the    establishment of rural communes with a crash program of village    industrialization. The Great Leap forced the abandonment of farming    activities, leading to widespread famine in which more than 20 million    people died of malnutrition.</p>   <h5 class="pagebreak"><b>China Is Condemned for Poor Treatment of Tibetans</b></h5>    <p style="font-size:13px">In 1959, a failed uprising against China's    invasion and occupation of Tibet forced Tibetan Buddhism's spiritual    leader, the Dalai Lama, and 100,000 of his followers to flee to India. The    invasion of Tibet and a perceived rivalry for the leadership of the world    Communist movement caused a serious souring of relations between China and    the USSR, former allies. In 1965 Tibet was formally made an autonomous    region of China. China's harsh religious and cultural persecution of    Tibetans, which continues to this day, has spawned growing international    protest.</p>    <p style="font-size:13px">The failure of the Great Leap Forward touched    off a power struggle within the Chinese Communist Party between Mao and    his supporters and a reformist faction including future premier Deng    Xiaoping. Mao moved to Shanghai, and from that base he and his supporters    waged what they called the Cultural Revolution. Beginning in the spring of    1966, Mao ordered the closing of schools and the formation of    ideologically pure Red Guard units, dominated by youths and students. The    Red Guards campaigned against &ldquo;old ideas, old culture, old habits,    and old customs.&rdquo; Millions died in a series of violent purges. By    early 1967, the Cultural Revolution had succeeded in bolstering Mao's    position as China's paramount leader.</p>    <h5 class="pagebreak"><b>President Nixon's Visit to China Establishes New Relations</b></h5>    <p style="font-size:13px">Anxious to exploit the Sino-Soviet rift, the    Nixon administration made a dramatic announcement in July 1971 that    National Security Adviser Henry Kissinger had secretly visited Beijing and    reached an agreement whereby Nixon would visit China. The movement toward    reconciliation, which signaled the end of the U.S. containment policy    toward China, provided momentum for China's admission to the UN. Despite    U.S. opposition to expelling Taiwan (Nationalist China), the world body    overwhelmingly voted to oust Taiwan in favor of Beijing's Communist    government.</p>    <p style="font-size:13px">President Nixon went to Beijing for a week early    in 1972, meeting Mao as well as Zhou. The summit ended with a historic    communiqu&eacute; on Feb. 28, in which both nations promised to work    toward improved relations. Full diplomatic relations were barred by China    as long as the U.S. continued to recognize the legitimacy of Nationalist    China.</p>    <p style="font-size:13px">Following Zhou's death on Jan. 8, 1976, his    successor, Vice Premier Deng Xiaoping, was supplanted within a month by    Hua Guofeng, former minister of public security. Hua became permanent    premier in April. In Oct. he was named successor to Mao as chairman of the    Communist Party. But Mao's death on Sept. 10 unleashed the bitter    intraparty rivalries that had been suppressed since the Cultural    Revolution. Old opponents of Mao launched a campaign against his widow,    Jiang Qing, and three of her &ldquo;radical&rdquo; colleagues. The    so-called Gang of Four was denounced for having undermined the party, the    government, and the economy. They were tried and convicted in 1981.    Meanwhile, in 1977, Deng Xiaoping was reinstated as deputy premier, chief    of staff of the army, and member of the Central Committee of the    Politburo.</p>    <p style="font-size:13px">Beijing and Washington announced full diplomatic    relations on Jan. 1, 1979, and the Carter administration abrogated the    Taiwan defense treaty. Deputy Premier Deng sealed the agreement with a    visit to the U.S. that coincided with the opening of embassies in both    capitals on March 1. On Deng's return from the U.S., Chinese troops    invaded and briefly occupied an area along Vietnam's northern border. The    action was seen as a response to Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia and ouster    of the Khmer Rouge government, which China had supported.</p>    <p style="font-size:13px">In 1981, Deng prot&eacute;g&eacute; Hu Yaobang    replaced Hua Guofeng as party chairman. Deng became chairman of the    Central Committee's military commission, giving him control over the army.    The body's 215 members concluded the session with a statement holding Mao    Zedong responsible for the &ldquo;grave blunder&rdquo; of the Cultural    Revolution.</p>    <p style="font-size:13px">Under Deng Xiaoping's leadership, meanwhile,    China's Communist ideology went through a massive reinterpretation, and    sweeping economic changes were set in motion in the early 1980s. The    Chinese scrapped the personality cult that idolized Mao Zedong, muted    Mao's old call for class struggle and exportation of the Communist    revolution, and imported Western technology and management techniques to    replace the Marxist tenets that had slowed modernization.</p>   <h5 class="pagebreak"><b>Student Demonstrators Are Killed at Tiananmen Square</b></h5>    <p style="font-size:13px">The removal of Hu Yaobang as party chairman in    Jan. 1987 signaled a hard-line resurgence within the party. Hu&mdash;who    had become a hero to many reform-minded Chinese&mdash;was replaced by    former premier Zhao Ziyang. With the death of Hu in April 1989, the    ideological struggle spilled into the streets of the capital, as student    demonstrators occupied Beijing's Tiananmen Square in May, calling for    democratic reforms. Less than a month later, the demonstrations were    crushed in a bloody crackdown as troops and tanks moved into the square    and fired on protesters, killing several hundred.</p>    <p style="font-size:13px">In annual sessions of the rubber-stamp National    People's Congress in 1992 and 1993, the government called for accelerating    the drive for economic reform, but the sessions were widely seen as an    effort to maintain China's moves toward a market economy while retaining    political authoritarianism. At the session in 1993, Communist Party leader    Jiang Zemin was elected president, while hard-liner Li Peng was reelected    to another five-year term as prime minister. Since 1993, the Chinese    economy has continued to grow rapidly.</p>    <h5 class="pagebreak"><b>China Becomes an Economic Power, but Continues to Suppress Personal    Liberties</b></h5>    <p style="font-size:13px">Deng Xiaoping's death in Feb. 1997 left a    younger generation in charge of managing the enormous country. In 1998,    Prime Minister Zhu Rongji introduced a sweeping program to privatize    state-run businesses and further liberalize the nation's economy, a move    lauded by Western economists.</p>    <p style="font-size:13px">On July 1, 1997, when Britain's lease on the New    Territories expired, Hong Kong returned to Chinese sovereignty, and in    1999, the Portuguese colony of Macao also was returned to Chinese    rule.</p>    <p style="font-size:13px">In Aug. 1999, China rounded up thousands of    members of the Falun Gong sect, a highly popular religious movement. The    government considers the apolitical spiritual group threatening because    its numbers exceeded the membership of the Chinese Communist Party. China    severely restricts its citizens' civil, religious, and political rights.    The use of torture has been widely documented, and for many years it has    executed more people than any other country in the world, carrying out    more than three-quarters of the world's executions.</p>    <p style="font-size:13px">China was admitted to the World Trade    Organization in Nov. 2001. Its entry ended a 15-year debate over whether    China is entitled to the full trading rights of capitalist countries.</p>    <p style="font-size:13px">In Nov. 2002, Vice President Hu Jintao became    general secretary of the Communist Party at the 16th Party Congress,    succeeding President Jiang. Hu Jintao also assumed the presidency in March    2003.</p>    <p style="font-size:13px">Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a    worldwide health threat, hit China in March 2003. After coming under fire    by the World Health Organization for underreporting the number of its SARS    cases, China finally revealed the alarming extent of its epidemic.</p>    <p style="font-size:13px">Beijing officials angered democracy advocates in    Hong Kong in April 2004, when they banned popular elections for Hong    Kong's chief executive, scheduled for 2007.</p>    <p style="font-size:13px">Tension between China and Taiwan intensified in    March 2005, when China passed an antisecession law that said the country    could use force if Taiwan moved toward achieving independence. &ldquo;The    state shall employ non-peaceful means and other necessary measures to    protect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity,&rdquo; the    legislation said. Taiwanese president Chen Shui-bian called the bill a    &ldquo;law of aggression.&rdquo;</p>    <p style="font-size:13px">In June 2005, the China National Oil Corporation    (Cnoc) bid $18.5 billion to take over the U.S. oil company Unocal. The    Chinese firm withdrew the bid in August amid strong resistance from U.S.    officials.</p>    <p style="font-size:13px">After months of pressure from the Bush    administration, China announced in July 2005 that it will no longer peg    the yuan to the dollar. Instead, the yuan is linked to a fluctuating group    of foreign currencies.</p>    <p style="font-size:13px">The police shot and killed about 20 people who    were protesting the construction of a power plant in the southern city of    Dongzhou in December. Chinese officials blocked the spread of information    about the event.</p>    <p style="font-size:13px">Government officials announced in December that    China's economy had grown by 9% in 2005. China is poised to have the    world's fourth-largest economy, after the United States, Japan, and    Germany.</p>    <p style="font-size:13px">In May 2006, China completed construction on the    Three Gorges Dam, the largest hydroelectric dam in the world. More than a    million people will be displaced when the area is flooded. In July 2006,    China opened a $4.2-billion, 710-mile-long railway from Qinghai Province    to the Tibetan capital of Lhasa. The highest railway in the world, it    ascends as high as 16,500 ft, requiring all compartments to have regulated    oxygen levels. The railway will increase ethnic Chinese migration into    Tibet, which many see as a deliberate attempt to dilute Tibetan    culture.</p>    <p style="font-size:13px">China tested its first antisatellite weapon in    January 2007, successfully destroying one of its own weather satellites.    Analysts deemed the move a provocative challenge to the United States'    supremacy in space-based technology. Others speculated that China is    seeking to push the U.S. toward signing a treaty to ban space-based    weapons.</p>    <p style="font-size:13px">In the spring and summer of 2007, dog food and    toothpaste products that originated in China were recalled due to the    presence of poisonous ingredients, leading many to question the safety of    Chinese products and the reliability of its regulatory system. In July,    China's former head of the State Food and Drug Administration was executed    for accepting bribes from pharmaceutical companies in exchange for    favors.</p>    <h5 class="pagebreak"><b>Natural Disasters Ravage China</b></h5>    <p style="font-size:13px">In January 2008, severe snowstorms in eastern    and southern China killed at least 24 people. Half of the country's 31    provinces lost power, about 827,000 people were evacuated from their    homes, at least 600,000 train passengers were stranded, and some 20 major    airports were closed. The economic cost of the storm is projected to be    $3.2 billion.</p>    <p style="font-size:13px">In March, some 400 Buddhist monks participated    in a protest march in Lhasa to commemorate the failed uprising of 1959,    that resulted in the Dalai Lama fleeing to India. The protests, the    largest in two decades, turned violent, with ethnic Tibetans reportedly    attacking Chinese citizens and vandalizing public and private property.    Chinese police used force to suppress the demonstrations. Tibetan leaders    said that more than 100 Tibetans were killed, but Chinese officials    claimed only 16 fatalities occurred and denied that police had used lethal    force. China barred many international news organizations from the country    and limited the flow of information out of the country. The demonstrations    and violence spilled into Gansu, Qinghai, and Sichuan Provinces in western    China. Chinese officials accused the Dalai Lama of masterminding the    protests, a charge the spiritual leader denied. Zhang Qingli, Tibet's    Communist Party leader, reportedly called the Dalai Lama &ldquo;a jackal    in Buddhist monk&rsquo;s robes, an evil spirit with a human face and the    heart of a beast."</p>    <p style="font-size:13px">President Hu visited Japan in May and cited an    "everlasting warm spring" in relations between the countries. It was the    first visit by a Chinese head of state in a decade. While Hu and Japan's    prime minister Yasuo Fukuda failed to make progress on resolving a dispute    involving a gasfield in the East China Sea, they did agree to regular    meetings, signaling a thaw in their cool relationship.</p>    <p style="font-size:13px">At least 68,000 people were killed and thousands    injured when a 7.9 magnitude earthquake struck Sichuan, Gansu, and Yunnan    Provinces in western China on May 12. Nearly 900 students were killed when    Juyuan Middle School in the Sichuan Province collapsed. Several other    schools also collapsed, killing about 10,000 students. In addition, a    well-known panda reserve in Wenchuan was destroyed. The disaster was    further complicated by landslides in Sichuan Province that blocked rivers    and formed quake lakes that officials feared may cause devastating floods.    It was China's worst natural disaster in three decades. In September, the    Chinese government acknowledged that poor construction of hastily built    schools possibly contributed to their collapse in the earthquake.</p>    <h5 class="pagebreak"><b>China Hosts a Successful Olympics</b></h5>    <p style="font-size:13px">The 2008 Summer Olympic Games kicked off on Aug. 8, 2008, with a    spectacular opening ceremony that many observers called unparalleled. In    the lead-up to the games, however, China was dogged by its abysmal    human-rights record, crackdown on the Buddhist monks, nearly intolerable    air quality, attempts to censor some journalists reporting on the Games,    and continued ties to the Sudanese government. In addition, four days    before the opening of the Games, two members of the Turkestan Independence    Movement, which is also called the Turkestan Islamic Party, a Muslim group    based in western China, drove a truck into a group of police officers and    then threw explosives and stabbed them. Sixteen police officers died and    another 16 were wounded in the attack. Days later, another 12 people were    killed in a wave of bombings attributed to the group. As host of the    Olympics, China exceeded expectations, despite its moves to stifle    protests and dissent, proving that the country is an economic powerhouse.    China also won a record 51 gold medals, and a total of 100 medals.</p>     <p style="font-size:13px">The good will and enthusiasm that followed the Olympic Games was    tarnished in September amid reports that three children died and more than    53,000 became sick after drinking milk-based formula that was tainted with    melamine, an industrial chemical that's made from coal and used to produce    plastic and fertilizer. Officials reportedly knew of the scandal months    before it was publicly disclosed.</p>    <h5 class="pagebreak"><b>Space Exploration, Government Reforms, and Military Crackdowns</b></h5>	 	 <p style="font-size:13px">On Sept. 27, 2008, astronaut Zhai Zhigang stepped out of the <i>Shenzhou    VII</i> spacecraft and made the first spacewalk by a Chinese astronaut.    The achievement was an important step in China's quest to build a    space station by 2020 and someday land on the Moon.</p>     <p style="font-size:13px">The government announced a land reform policy in Oct. 2008 that will    allow farmers to "subcontract, lease, exchange, or swap" rights to the    plots of land assigned to them by the government. The government said it    hopes the policy change, which coincided with the 30th anniversary of land    reforms under Deng Xiaoping, will lead to increased output and greater    efficiency.</p>    <p style="font-size:13px"> With countries all over the world facing a financial crisis, China's    State Council announced in November that it will spend about $586 billion,    or about 7% of China's GDP, on a stimulus package that will include    building new airports, subways, low-income housing, and rail systems.</p>	 	  <p style="font-size:13px">Although China was generally praised for its handling of 2008's earthquake in Sichuan, by the quake's one-year anniversary in 2009, some of the international goodwill had evaporated. China restricted access to the area by journalists and artists; parents of children who where killed in the quake had their complaints ignored and suppressed; and the government's official investigation into the schools and hospitals that collapsed in the quake claimed that none had been improperly constructed. The government did implement new regulations for the construction of schools and hospitals, but that was little comfort to bereaved parents and international organizations demanding accountability.</p>	  <p style="font-size:13px">On the 20th anniversary of the violent military crackdown in Tiananmen Square that left hundreds of democratic activists dead, China tried to deter remembrance of the event. Police officers stood guard around the square, barring foreign journalists from entering. In response, tens of thousands of people held a candlelight vigil in Hong Kong to mark the anniversary of the brutal killings.</p>	 	  <p style="font-size:13px">Rioting in Urumqi, China between two ethnic groups&mdash;Muslim Uighurs and Han Chinese&mdash;led to the deaths of at least 156 people at the hands of the police on July 6, 2009. Riot police locked down the Uighur portion of the city to try and stop the protests. It was the worst ethnic violence in decades.</p> <p style="font-size:13px">Taiwan and China signed a landmark free-trade agreement in June 2010 that lifts or reduces hundreds of tariffs for both sides. Officials from both Taiwan and China described the deal as the most important achievement since the 1949 civil war. Taiwan seems poised to benefit more economically from the deal than China, and China sees a political benefit as the agreement brings the two closer together.</p><p style="font-size:13px">The exiled Dalai Lama, who has lived in the northern Indian town of Dharamsala since 1959, sent a shockwave through Tibet in March 2011 when he stepped down as leader, requested a demotion to elected politician, and proposed amendments to the constitution. While he has made a clear break with politics, the Daliai Lama remains the spiritual leader of Tibetan Buddhism. </p><p style="font-size:13px">In April 2011, the government-in-exile of Tibet swore in a new prime minister, the first to be elected since the Dalai Lama renounced his position.  Lobsang Sangay, a 42-year-old fellow at Harvard Law School, campaigned for an autonomous future for Tibet under Chinese sovereignty. The new prime minister polled 27,051  votes, 55% of the total electorate, to beat two other secular  candidates.  China has not acknowledged him.</p><h5 class="pagebreak"><b>Leaders Propose Strict Limits on Media</b></h5>   <p style="font-size:13px">Perhaps in reaction to popular uprisings going on around the world, leaders in China proposed new limits on Internet use and media in October 2011. The proposal included some of the strictest measures in years. For example, the State Administration of Radio, Film and Television limited 34 major television stations to two 90-minute entertainment shows per week. The same TV stations were also limited to two hours of news every evening. The two hours of news must be approved by the state. Audience ratings were ordered to be ignored.</p>        <p style="font-size:13px">Leaders said the new limits would go into effect January 1, 2012. The media crackdown coincides with an upcoming switch in leadership within the government and ruling party, a shift that will take place over the next year.</p>       <h5 class="pagebreak"><b>China Sides with Russia to Block U.N. Action in Syria</b></h5>              <p style="font-size:13px">In February 2012, China joined Russia in making international headlines by blocking an effort by the United Nations Security Council to end the violence in Syria. Both countries vetoed the resolution just hours after the Syrian military launched an assault on the city of Homs. The Security Council voted 13 to 2 for a resolution backing an Arab League peace plan for Syria. Russia and China voted against the resolution, seeing it as a violation of Syria's sovereignty. Syria's 11-month uprising has caused more than 5,000 casualties.</p>               <p style="font-size:13px">On February 14, 2012, Xi Jinping, vice president of China, arrived in the United States for a visit. China's presumptive next president, Jinping was watched closely on his visit by American leaders, who looked for clues to his future policies on critical issues such as the nuclear programs of North Korea and Iran.</p>                <p style="font-size:13px">On July 19 2012, China sided with Russia again and vetoed a United Nations Security Council resolution to impose sanctions on the Syrian government. The proposed U.N. sanctions were intended to push Syria into putting a peace plan into action and ending its 17-month-old conflict. The resolution was proposed by Britain and backed by ten other council members, including France and the United States.</p>                    <h5 class="pagebreak"><b>Blind Dissident Seeks Refuge at American Embassy</b></h5>              <p style="font-size:13px">In April 2012, Chen Guangcheng, a blind lawyer and one of China's most well-known dissidents, escaped from his rural home where he had been under house arrest since 2010. Chen went to the American Embassy in Beijing where he asked U.S. officials for help. On May 2, Chen left the embassy to receive medical treatment at a hospital in Beijing for an injured foot. After tense negotiations, the Chinese government agreed to relocate him away from Shandong Province, his hometown, where Chen said his family had been attacked. The government also promised that Chen would be allowed to pursue his law studies at a university. Chen's friends questioned the validity of the government's promises and, while in the hospital, Chen admitted he left the U.S. embassy in part because the Chinese government officials threatened his wife's life if he remained there. Although Chen's friends had said he desired to stay in China, he went on to say, while in the hospital, that he wanted to leave the country because "guaranteeing citizens' rights in China is empty talk." </p>                <p style="font-size:13px">On May 4, 2012, Chen requested help from Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton, who was in China for meetings on economic and security issues. Chen revised his request, asking if he and his family could go to the U.S. temporarily instead of receiving permanent asylum. Clinton and the Obama administration worked quickly to negotiate with Chinese officials to avoid an increase in tensions between the two governments. During her visit, Clinton said that progress was being made "to help him have the future that he wants." On May 5, China agreed to allow Chen to apply to study in the United States, a move which was quickly praised by Clinton.</p>                   <p style="font-size:13px">On May 19, after leaving Beijing with his wife and two children, Chen arrived in New York City where he would live and study at New York University. He spoke at a press conference where he said he was grateful to the American Embassy. He also thanked Chinese officials for "dealing with the situation with restraint and calm." About the Chinese government, he added, "I hope to see that they continue to open discourse and earn the respect and trust of the people."</p>         		    <h5 class="pagebreak"><b>Tension Increases with Asian Neighbors Over Islands in 2012</b></h5>              <p style="font-size:13px">Regional tension over claims to islands and resources in the South China Sea flared throughout 2012. For centuries, China has declared sovereignty over the sea and many of its islands, including the Paracel and Spratly islands, which are rich in oil and gas reserves and fish. However, Vietnam has also laid claim to the Paracel and Spratly island chains, and the Philippines say the Spratly Islands are within their territorial claims.</p>              <p style="font-size:13px"> While the issue has been festering for decades, China took a tougher stance in 2012, warning other nations to refrain from oil and gas exploration and placing naval vessels in the South China Sea. At the same time, Vietnam and the Philippines have been more aggressively dispatching ships-both military and civilian-to the sea. There was little hope that the nations could solve the problem diplomatically, with China saying it would only negotiate bilaterally and both Vietnam and the Philippines both insisting that the U.S. and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) mediate the dispute.</p><h5 class="pagebreak"><b>China's Economy Falls to a Three-Year Low in 2012</b></h5><p style="font-size:13px">In a June 2012 quarter ending report, China's economic growth fell to a three-year low. Economists predicted that it would decline even more before rebounding. However, by September 2012, consumer inflation had eased to 1.9 percent from 2.0percent in August. The drop in inflation gave the government room to cut interest rates and was a positive signthat China's economy would soon be on the upswing again.</p> <p style="font-size:13px">Also, while China's growth slowed in 2012, it was still the leader of all the major emerging economies. China's GDP growth was 7.6 percent in the year's second quarter, ahead of India (5.5 percent), Russia (4 percent), and South Africa (3.2 percent). Moreover, while there was a slowdown in China's production and consumption of consumer goods, basic resources, and materials; the country's tourism, education, medical care, and luxury car industries thrived throughout 2012.</p> <h5 class="pagebreak"><b>The Transfer of Power Begins</b></h5><p style="font-size:13px">On November 8, 2012, the Chinese Communist Party's 18th Congress convened in Beijing, beginning its leadership transition. Having ruled China since 1949, the party faced its biggest transfer of power in years. It was only the second time the party prepared to transfer power from one leader to another without violence or protest. The only previous time was when current President Hu Jintao took over for Jiang Zemin in 2002. </p> <p style="font-size:13px">The 18th Congress began with the expectation that changes were coming in every area of the Chinese Communist Party. For example, seven out of nine members of the party's elite Standing Committee were scheduled to retire. The biggest change would obviously be Vice President Xi Jinping taking over as president. When he takes over as president in March 2013, Xi, the son of a revolutionary leader, will face the daunting task of maintaining economic growth and increasing China's role as a global power. </p> <p style="font-size:13px">On November 9, 2012, Google confirmed that all of its services including Gmail, maps, and its search engine were not accessible in China. The service interruption came just as the 18th Congress convened. Chinese cyber-police also took further steps to control information ahead of the leadership transition in the Communist Party. Companies in and around Beijing were ordered to use computer hardware to log online traffic and block certain Web sites.</p> <h5 class="pagebreak"><b>Protests over Newspaper Censorship Grows</b></h5><p style="font-size:13px">Protest began in early January 2013 over censorship of Southern Weekend, a newspaper. Journalists at the paper said local propaganda officials were interfering with their reporting and called for the ouster of Tuo Zhen, a propaganda official in the Guangdong Province. The journalists at Southern Weekend said he was responsible for a change in a recent editorial that called for more respect for constitutional rights. By the time the piece was published it praised the current political system.</p><p style="font-size:13px">On January 7, 2013, hundreds of people gathered outside of the Southern Weekend headquarters to protest against the censorship. Meanwhile celebrities responded with a show of support via the internet. Actress Yao Chen quoted Russian dissident Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn online: One word of truth outweighs the whole world. Hung Huang, an entrepreneur, stated online that Tuo "destroyed, overnight, all the credibility the country's top leadership had labored to re-establish since the 18th Party Congress."</p>  <h5 class="pagebreak"><b>Chinese Hackers Attack The New York Times</b></h5><p style="font-size:13px">For four months in late 2012 and early 2013, hackers in China attacked <i>The New York Times</i>. The hacking included gaining access to the paper's computer systems and getting employee's passwords. The attacks came at the same time that <i>The New York Times</i> reported on an investigation that Prime Minister Wen Jiabao's relatives had acquired a several billion dollar fortune through business dealings.</p><p style="font-size:13px"><i>The New York Times</i> hired computer security experts to study the hacker's activity. After gathering evidence, the security experts were able to push the hackers out and block them from returning. According to the security experts, no customer data was stolen. The experts believed that the attack was part of a wider computer espionage mission against U.S. news media outlets that report on Chinese leaders and business dealings. In fact, a day after <i>The New York Times</i> reported the incident; <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> revealed in a statement that hackers had infiltrated it, too, "for the apparent purpose of monitoring the newspaper's China coverage."</p><p style="font-size:13px">On February 19, 2013, a 60-page study was released by Mandiant, a U.S. computer security firm, which showed evidence linking Unit 61398, a Chinese military unit, to the groups responsible for a large portion of the recent hacking in the United States. The study, which included digital forensic evidence, didn't prove that the hackers were inside the military unit's headquarters, but did show evidence that they were either inside or very close to Unit 61398. </p><h5 class="pagebreak"><b>The Transfer of Power is Complete</b></h5><p style="font-size:13px">On Thursday, March 14, 2013, Xi Jingping assumed the presidency of China. Of the 2,956 delegates, only one voted against Xi. Three delegates abstained. Li Yuanchao was named vice president.</p> <p style="font-size:13px">Assuming the presidency completed the transition of power to Xi. The process began four months ago when he was named chairman of the Central Military Commission and general secretary of the Communist Party. This final step put him in charge of all three centers of power in China.</p><h5 class="pagebreak"><b>Powerful Earthquake Kills 186 in Sichuan Province</b></h5><p style="font-size:13px">A strong earthquake struck southwestern China. At least 186 people were killed and around 8,200 people were injured. The earthquake caused mountainsides to collapse into valleys. Available drinking water became a problem following the earthquake.</p> <p style="font-size:13px">Reports conflicted on the magnitude of the earthquake. China's Earthquake Networks Center reported that the earthquake was a 7.0 magnitude, while the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) put it at 6.6. A series of aftershocks followed. According to the USGS, some of the aftershocks were a magnitude of 5.1.</p><br />      <p style="font-size:13px"><i>See also </i>Encyclopedia: <a    href="/cgi-bin/id/CE010723">China</a>. <br /><a    href="/country/profiles/china.html">U.S. State Dept.
