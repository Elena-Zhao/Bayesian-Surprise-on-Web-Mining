First Emperor Qin Shi      Huang (260-210 B.C.) of the Qin dynasty first unified China in 221 B.C.,      beginning an Imperial period which would last until A.D. 1912.<sup>k</sup></li>	  <li>China is often considered the longest continuous civilization, with some      historians marking 6000 B.C. as the dawn of Chinese civilization. It also      has the world&rsquo;s longest continuously used written language.<sup>c</sup></li><li>China is the fourth largest country in the world (after Russia, Canada,      and the U.S.). It has an area of 3,719,275 square miles (slightly smaller      than the U.S.) and its borders with other countries total more than 117,445      miles. Approximately 5,000 islands lie off the Chinese coast.<sup>a</sup></li>	  <li>One in every five people in the world is Chinese. China&rsquo;s population      is estimated to reach a whopping 1,338,612,968 by July 2009. China&rsquo;s      population is four times that of the United States.<sup>a</sup></li>	  <li>Fortune cookies are not a traditional Chinese custom.

They were used to frighten the enemies      in battle, and Marco Polo (1254-1324) noted that kites were also used to      predict the success of a voyage. It was considered bad luck to purposely      let a kite go.<sup>i</sup></li><li>Cricket fighting is a popular amusement in China.

Parachutes were not used safely and effectively      in Europe until the late 1700s.<sup>m</sup></li><li>The custom of binding feet (euphemistically called &ldquo;golden lilies&rdquo;)      began among female entertainers and members of the Chinese court during      the Song dynasty (A.D. 960-1279). Tightly wrapped bandages gradually broke      the arch of the foot and caused the woman&rsquo;s toes and heel to grow inward      toward one another. Her leg muscles would also atrophy and become very      thin. Bound feet were seen as highly sexual.<sup>m</sup></li><li>Historians speculate that as the Chinese population grew, people had to conserve      cooking fuel by chopping food into small pieces so that it could cook faster.      These bite-sized foods eliminated the need for knives and, hence, chopsticks      were invented.<sup>c</sup></li><li>In A.D. 130, Zhang Heng, an astronomer and literary scholar, invented the first instrument for monitoring      earthquakes.

Europe didn&rsquo;t begin using      the iron plow until the seventeenth century.<sup>m</sup></li><li>The name of China&rsquo;s capital has changed over the centuries. At      one time or another it has been known as Yanjing, Dadu, and Beiping.

Beijing is the second largest city after Shanghai.<sup>h</sup></li><li>It was customary for wealthy men and women in the late empire to grow      the nails of their little fingers extremely long as a sign of their rank.

The scales and whiskers      of the fish make it resemble a dragon, the greatest symbol of power in China.
