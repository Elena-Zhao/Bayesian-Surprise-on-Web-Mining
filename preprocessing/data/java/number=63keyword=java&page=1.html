Many of you may remember it! Matt Parsons and partners   come along in 1993 and opened a coffee and dessert shop in the building, hence   the name Java Java. They still sold flowers at that time. <br />          <br />          Soon after they   started serving breakfast, lunch and dinner and they were open 24 hours a day.   Some time later Matt bought out his partners to operate Java Jave Cafe on his   own. That has continued until today. More recently Matt decided to concentrate   on serving wonderful breakfasts and lunches.<br />          <br />          <strong>WE HAVE GREAT DAILY   SPECIALS:</strong><br />          <br />          Monday - Pasta Italiano<br />          Tuesday - Mexican Day<br />          Wednesday -   Meatloaf or King Ranch Chicken<br />          Thursday - Chicken Fried   Steak/Chicken/Porkchops<br />          Friday - Fish Day<br />          <br />          <strong>OUR CHEF HAS BEEN WITH JAVA JAVA CAFE FOR 18 YEARS!
