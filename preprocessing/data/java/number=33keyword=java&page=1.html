Some of the best ideas and apps come not from an individual, but from a collaboration of developers.\n\nWhile it may seem easier to find tech teammates in major tech hubs, there are ways to meet up with developers in every city. As our latest Ask a Dev video explains, you don't have to live in Silicon Valley or New York City to network with other developers.\n\nSee also: Ask a Dev: What Are the Best Android Tutorials for New Developers?\n\nAndroid engineer Sagar Seth suggests looking online for developers' groups and possible collaborators. Sites like MeetUp.com and Google Developer Groups serve as online forums for developers in a certain city to post about their next in-person meeting.\n\nDevelopers can also work remotely and collaborate with others online, Seth says. GitHub and StackOverflow are online networks of developers that users can access from anywhere with an Internet connection.\n\nIn the video, above, Seth also discusses how a newbie developer who doesn't understand script can start producing Android web apps.\n\nOur developer experts are from Mutual Mobile, a leading development and design firm that builds mobile strategies for top companies such as Audi, Google and Citigroup.

At least one of those Java flaws led to the recently disclosed network penetrations of Apple,\u00a0Facebook\u00a0and Microsoft, and may have also been involved in the compromise of 250,000 Twitter accounts.\n\nBecause of these dangers, many security experts recommend that users disable Java browser plug-ins, or even to take the more drastic step of uninstalling the underlying Java Runtime Environment (JRE) entirely.\n\nThose recommendations may make sense for many, but they are not blanket solutions for all users with Java installed on their machines.\n\nCaffeinated World\n\nThe problem is that Java, in one form or another, is still used for a lot of things that people want and need to do. It might be an essential element of running programs that you never considered.\n\nIf, for example, you are one of the millions of people who enjoy playing Minecraft or RuneScape, you'll need Java installed on your machine. If you play \"World of Warcraft,\" getting rid of Java might leave you without the use of the game's launcher.\n\nIf you're a creative professional, Adobe's Creative Suite, which includes applications such as Photoshop, Illustrator and Premiere, relies on Java to exchange information among applications. If you're a user of free office software like OpenOffice and LibreOffice, both programs use Java.\n\nNone of those applications normally access websites, so leaving Java installed on your computer while disabling it in your Web browsers will let you use those pieces of software while minimizing your exposure to malware.\n\nUnfortunately, that isn't possible with many web-facing business applications that absolutely require that Java plug-ins be active in a browser, such as web-conferencing software like Citrix's GoToMeeting or Cisco's WebEx.\n\nSEE ALSO: Why and How to Disable Java on Your Computer\n\nLet's Be Careful Out There\n\nFor some people, turning off Java in the browser is simply not a realistic option. So what can you do to mitigate your risks when using Java on the Web?\n\nThe first thing is to follow information-security best practices, which will make it harder for malicious code to infect and damage your system.\n\n\"Use anti-virus, anti-malware software and a firewall,\" said Ross Barrett, senior manager of security engineering at Boston-based Rapid7. \"Browse with a user account that does not have administrator privileges.\u201d\n\nThere are also some basic Java security precautions that you can take to make sure that you are limiting your risks.\n\n\"Java users should stay up to date with patches and software revisions. When an update comes out, apply it immediately. This drastically lowers your surface of exposure and ensures that you have the latest built-in protections,\" Barrett said.\n\n\"Turn up [Java's] security settings,\" he added. \"This will mean that you'll get frequent warning messages and alerts while you browse \u2014 don't ignore them.\"\n\nTwice the Fun\n\nEnd users may want to try a \"double browser\" strategy.\n\n\u201cIf you do rely on websites that require Java, consider installing a second browser and turning Java on in that browser only,\" said Richard Wang, senior security manager at the British anti-virus firm Sophos. \"Use it for your Java-based websites only, and stick to your Java-disabled main browser for everything else.\"\n\nFor businesses, people who work at home or anyone with an abundance of sensitive data to protect, a beefier version of this strategy can keep Java security problems from becoming system-wide issues.\n\n\u201cYou should make a list of all the tools you use on a regular basis and that require Java. Then, run these tools in a virtual machine or other isolated environment,\" said Tim Erlin, director of IT security and risk strategy for San Francisco's nCircle, referring to software-based computer emulators that essentially \"live\" inside other computers.\n\n\"If you find that you need Java for many of your routine tasks,\" Erlin said, \"it might be time to consider evaluating alternate tools that don't require Java.\"\n\nWill these strategies be a silver bullet that will protect you from all of the security problems that have been plaguing Java on the Web? No, but in IT security there are no guarantees. You can only mitigate your risks and take reasonable precautions.\n\nAfter all, Java is not the only browser plug-in that can be exploited to install malicious code. If you uninstalled or disabled every possible risk, then the Web would lose the majority of its functionality.\n\nPractical security is about playing the odds and getting the best possible protection without putting everything on lockdown.\n\nMashable composite image"},"shares":{"twitter":1085,"facebook":149,"linked_in":85,"google_plus":22,"stumble_upon":647,"pinterest":2,"total":1990},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzAyLzI2Lzk4L0phdmF0aHJlYXQuZGQwN2QuanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJOTUweDUzNCMKZQlqcGc/74de838b/259/Java-threat.jpg","feature_image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzAyLzI2Lzk4L0phdmF0aHJlYXQuZGQwN2QuanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJMTQzOHgKZQlqcGc/4df4a4f1/259/Java-threat.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzAyLzI2Lzk4L0phdmF0aHJlYXQuZGQwN2QuanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJMjAweDExNSMKZQlqcGc/90bcba10/259/Java-threat.jpg","query":true,"size":"200x115#"},{"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEzLzAyLzI2Lzk4L0phdmF0aHJlYXQuZGQwN2QuanBnCnAJdGh1bWIJNDAweDIzMCMKZQlqcGc/f85568e1/259/Java-threat.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"400x230#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/X7GgKG","choice":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{},"excerpt":"For the last year or so, Java seems to have spawned a never-ending flow of security bugs, partly because of the software environment's invisibility to end users and partly because of the system access it allows.

It works by getting Java users to visit a website with malicious code that takes advantage of a security gap to take control of users' computers. \n\nUpdate: Oracle has released Java SE 7 Update 11 to address the vulnerability. It \"strongly recommends\" that Java SE 7 users upgrade immediately.\n\nWhat's worse is this particular exploit is reportedly being used to push ransomware, a type of attack that demands users pay to have control of their computers returned from a hacker's grasp.\n\nJava's creator, Oracle, hasn't specified the number of users who have downloaded Java 7 Update 10. However, Java runs on more than 850 million computers and other devices. When Oracle released Update 10, it \"strongly recommended\" that users update to receive \"key security features and bug fixes.\"\n\nThe exploit was first discovered by French researcher Kafeine, who claimed to have found it running on a site registering hundreds of thousands of page views daily.\n\n\"This could be a [sic] mayhem,\" Kafeine wrote.\n\nSEE ALSO: Is Your Mobile Device Safe From Hackers?\n\nShould you be worried about this exploit? While security lapses are sometimes overblown, there are good reasons to take this one seriously: The U.S. Department of Homeland Security issued a warning advising users to disable Java until a fix is discovered. Apple has apparently moved to disable Java in response to the threat. Mozilla took the opportunity to warn users and advertise \"Click to Play,\" a Firefox feature which stops Java from loading on individual web sites until a user allows it. Many security experts are advising users disable or uninstall Java for the time being.\n\nOur advice? It's probably a good idea to disable or uninstall Java until a fix is published. You can find out how to do that right here: How to disable Java in your web browser. How to uninstall Java for Mac. How to uninstall Java for Linux.\n\nHave you downloaded Java 7 Update 10?

According to an estimate from IT and research consulting company Gartner, about 25% of the 4.3 billion phones in use worldwide are smartphones. This year, Gartner expects sales of more than 1.85 billion phones, about 45% of which will be smartphones.\n\nFor the time being, then, biNu has plenty of potential users. Since launching 18 months ago, it has snagged four million customers. Most are in Asia and Africa -- top countries include India, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Ethiopia and Zimbabwe. While they don't pay to use biNu itself, they pay for the data consumed by using it (Lentell says users are on prepaid phone plans).\n\nSurfing the web on a laptop or desktop computer using a broadband connection is relatively painless: A browser does the work necessary to properly render the incoming HTML and other data on our screen. Using a mobile browser on a smartphone offers a similar experience, though generally with slower connection speeds and simpler, mobile-geared web pages. But trying to look at a website on a feature phone -- even if it's a simple WAP site -- can be much more tedious, since these devices have very limited processing capacities. And if you're trying to do this over a 2G network, it's even worse.\n\nBiNu takes a different approach. When you peruse an app through the main biNu app, each word you see on your screen was previously broken down, letter by letter, into a tiny image file on a remote server and sent wirelessly to your phone along with instructions about where it should go on the screen, Lentell says. \n\nOnce they've been sent, letters can essentially be recycled on subsequent screens of text, he says, and biNu also supports regular images.

However, Lentell says biNu is 10 times faster than using a standard browser on a feature phone, and it requires 10 times less data. \"Since we're so efficient on data, the cost to the end user is relatively small compared to starting the browser and doing the same thing,\" he says.\n\nStill, Brian Blau, a Gartner analyst, wonders how useful biNu will be as smartphones become more and more prevalent around the world. He's also concerned that it could be hampered by rules that social networks like Twitter and Facebook may make about how third-party companies present content that's created on their networks. \"You kind of have to wonder about the longevity of something like this,\" he says. \"But for today I think it's a relatively interesting solution.\""},"shares":{"twitter":141,"facebook":20,"linked_in":19,"google_plus":16,"pinterest":1,"total":197},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEyLzEyLzA0LzQ3L2ZyZWVhcHBtYWtlLmNIRC5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgk5NTB4NTM0IwplCWpwZw/b8026f30/d38/free-app-makes-dumb-phones-smarter-and-faster-2ed44fd0c2.jpg","feature_image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEyLzEyLzA0LzQ3L2ZyZWVhcHBtYWtlLmNIRC5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgkxNDM4eAplCWpwZw/80fc2566/d38/free-app-makes-dumb-phones-smarter-and-faster-2ed44fd0c2.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEyLzEyLzA0LzQ3L2ZyZWVhcHBtYWtlLmNIRC5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgkyMDB4MTE1IwplCWpwZw/30ae6d38/d38/free-app-makes-dumb-phones-smarter-and-faster-2ed44fd0c2.jpg","query":true,"size":"200x115#"},{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEyLzEyLzA0LzQ3L2ZyZWVhcHBtYWtlLmNIRC5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgk0MDB4MjMwIwplCWpwZw/3b863c38/d38/free-app-makes-dumb-phones-smarter-and-faster-2ed44fd0c2.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"400x230#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/RitPba","choice":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{},"excerpt":"Not having a smartphone or access to a high-speed mobile network doesn't mean you don't still want your phone to act brainy and speedy.

Unfortunately it didn't do much to resolve the conflict, failing to rule on a key point that would give either party a clear victory.\n\nBriefly, the jury found that Google infringed on Oracle's copyrights over Java code -- which serves as a basis for a big chunk of Android -- but didn't rule at all on whether or not Google's actions could be considered \"fair use.\" The judge in the case, U.S. District Court Judge William Alsup, has said he'll make a further ruling that will address that point and potentially alter the outcome with a final decision on whether software APIs (application programming interfaces) can be copyrighted.\n\nAPIs are used by many apps to standardize how they interact with other software. Instagram, for example, uses Foursquare's publicly available APIs to import location data from that service. Broadly, Oracle accuses Google of copying its Java APIs when it created Android.\n\nWhile the jury agreed with Oracle that Google infringed upon the \"overall structure, sequence and organization\" of Java, the idea of fair use throws the infringement into question. As the verdict stands now, Google's so-called violation would only cost the company up to $150,000 -- less than the company spends on lunch for its employees in five days. Orcale had sought $1 billion in damages.\n\nThere are two more parts to the trial, however. While the first part was attacked the issue of copyright, the next, which began Monday, turns the case toward patent law. The third and final phase will address damages.\n\nThose damages, at least in this part of the case, may be fairly small if Alsup rules that Google's implementation of Java is in fact fair use, an issue that left the jury deadlocked. Fair use is typically cited when using creative works -- excerpting part of a book or movie as part of a review, for instance -- but it's much less clear in its application to software. \n\nSEE ALSO: Google-Oracle Trial Begins Today, Could Change Android Forever\n\nPatent expert Florian Mueller -- who also does consulting for Oracle (see \"update\" below) -- says it's not even close, and there's no way Google's use of Java could be considered fair use. Stacking Google's actions up against fair-use law point by point, Mueller says the company adapting Java for Android is more akin to \"hijacking a platform.\" Google benefited from the development of Java by basing its code on it, then specifically made Android incompatible, effectively recruiting the Java-development community for its own mobile operating system.\n\nIf the judge rules that Google violated copyrights and fair use, it could have far-reaching consequences for software development generally, and cloud services specifically. George Reese, CTO of cloud-services provider enStratus Networks, tells Wired: \u201cIf APIs can be copy-protected, that would be incredibly destructive to the Internet as a whole for so many different reasons.\u201d\n\nMany cloud services, from OpenStack to Rackspace, have essentially copied the APIs from Amazon Web Services (AWS), the piece notes (AWS is by far the most popular cloud-hosting service). Should the case find that APIs are copyrightable and using them isn't fair use, all those companies would need to obtain licensing agreements with Amazon. Also, by virtue of copyright law, those copyrights would last 95 years.\n\nFor what it's worth, the man who invented Java for Sun Microsystems -- which Oracle acquired in 2010 -- thinks Google is in the wrong. Writing on his personal blog, James Gosling says, \"Just because Sun didn't have patent suits in our genetic code doesn't mean we didn't feel wronged. While I have differences with Oracle, in this case they are in the right. Google totally slimed Sun.\"\n\nAlthough Oracle's official statement about Monday's verdict essentially re-hashes its core argument that Google should have obtained a Java license in the first place, Google -- who has now formally requested a mistrial -- emphasizes that \"infringement and fair use are two sides of the same coin.\" In other words, if Google's use of Java is fair use, by definition it didn't infringe.\n\nIt's a logical argument, and it essentially makes the case an all-or-nothing affair. However, with the stakes this high, Google -- and the rest of the web -- should start preparing for the possibility that they lose that coin toss. If that happens, established companies will enjoy new protections and possibly new sources of revenue while startups and competitors will have fewer options when building APIs. The business of creating software will look quite different from what it is today.\n\nDo you think that's a bad or a good thing? Should software APIs be free to copy, or is such a free-for-all attitude killing legitimate licensing deals? Have your say in the comments.\n\nUpdate: Commenters and contacts have informed me that Florian Mueller works as a consultant for Oracle. He says so in this blog post, explaining that the timing of the relationship is a coincidence, and that his opinions on the Google-Oracle case are not related to his consulting work. We believe the substance of his remarks stands on its own, but we invite readers to draw their own conclusions.\n\nImage courtesy of iStockphoto, pagadesign"},"shares":{"linked_in":347,"facebook":463,"pinterest":7,"google_plus":120,"twitter":1053,"stumble_upon":87,"total":2077},"comments_count":40,"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEyLzEyLzA0LzU2L2lmZ29vZ2xlbG9zLmFNNS5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgk5NTB4NTM0IwplCWpwZw/0fe22b72/932/if-google-loses-the-oracle-battle-the-internet-will-never-be-the-same-14e8eec137.jpg","feature_image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEyLzEyLzA0LzU2L2lmZ29vZ2xlbG9zLmFNNS5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgkxNDM4eAplCWpwZw/9892b04c/932/if-google-loses-the-oracle-battle-the-internet-will-never-be-the-same-14e8eec137.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEyLzEyLzA0LzU2L2lmZ29vZ2xlbG9zLmFNNS5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgkyMDB4MTE1IwplCWpwZw/c21d488d/932/if-google-loses-the-oracle-battle-the-internet-will-never-be-the-same-14e8eec137.jpg","query":true,"size":"200x115#"},{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEyLzEyLzA0LzU2L2lmZ29vZ2xlbG9zLmFNNS5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgk0MDB4MjMwIwplCWpwZw/5813376e/932/if-google-loses-the-oracle-battle-the-internet-will-never-be-the-same-14e8eec137.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"400x230#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/KmsoV2","choice":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{},"excerpt":"A jury on Monday turned in the first big verdict in the high-stakes dispute over intellectual property between Google and Oracle.

The stakes are no less than the future of Android.\n\nOracle sued Google in 2010 over its use of Java, a software platform Oracle obtained from its acquisition of Sun Microsystems earlier that same year. Java is actually free to use without licensing it, but when Google developed its Android mobile operating system, it used many of Sun's Java APIs (application programming interfaces) so Android developers could create apps with Java.\n\nOracle says that's a no-no, and sued Google over seven of its Java-related patents. A judge threw out many of Oracle's claims, leaving just two patents in question. Talks between the two companies -- which saw CEOs Larry Page and Larry Ellison meet in person -- weren't fruitful, so the case is going to trial.\n\nWhile many of the IP cases recently making headlines have centered around patent infringement, the Google-Oracle showdown is different. Oracle claims Google actually violated its copyrights on Java, as a language. Oracle says that in creating the Java-based parts of Android, Google copied its Java APIs wholesale.\n\nGoogle doesn't deny this. However, it says there's nothing wrong with what it's done and makes the wholesale claim that APIs and programming languages shouldn't be entitled to copyright protection.\n\nGoogle's argument is that programming languages are merely the tools software developers use and aren't subject to copyright, though the programs they make with them are. It says Oracle is trying to copyright an idea rather than an expression -- one of the main distinctions about what can be copyrighted and what can't.\n\nSEE ALSO: Google Just Lost a Potential Ally in its Legal Tussle with Oracle\n\nNot so fast, Oracle says. In its brief, it says copyrights for APIs should be allowed since they are \"original expressions\" in software, which can't otherwise be protected by either trade-secrecy law (since they're easily reverse-engineered) or patent law (since it's too broad).\n\nSince talks have failed, here we are. As the trial progresses, there's still a decent chance of a settlement, but the stakes are high on the verdict.\n\nIf Oracle prevails, and Google doesn't opt for a full license on Java, Android could fundamentally change. If Google changes Android so it doesn't use Java, it would mean every app would need to be re-coded from the ground up. The platform is already mired with fragmentation -- such a change would essentially shatter Android into a thousand incompatible pieces.\n\nOf course, there's every chance Google will win, which would put Android in the clear. Predictably, this is the outcome developers tend to favor, as \"independent developer\" Malcolm Barclay tells the BBC, \"It would be utterly ridiculous to think that using an API could infringe upon the intellectual property rights of an open platform. ... It would be the equivalent of buying a music CD and suddenly finding someone wanted to charge you for listening to track 10.\"\n\nWho do you think should win the Oracle-Google trial?

While we each have our favorites, from new releases of classic tools to astounding announcements from tech companies, here, in no particular order, are a few stories that stood out to us this year.\n\nIn the comments, we'd love to know what stories stood out most to you this year, partly to indulge our sense of gratuitous end-of-year nostalgia and partly to help us hone our coverage for 2011, when we hope to bring you more fascinating web dev news than ever before.\n\nWhat were your favorite dev-related headlines of 2010?\n\n1. The Release of Rails 3.0\n\nEarly in February, the Ruby on Rails core team took the wraps off Rails 3.0, a long-awaited release of the popular Ruby framework.\n\nRails creator David Heinemeier Hansson wrote on the Rails blog, \"We\u2019ve had more than 250 people help with the release and we\u2019ve been through almost 4,000 commits since 2.3 to get here. Yet still the new version feels lighter, more agile, and easier to understand. \n\n\"It\u2019s a great day to be a Rails developer.\"\n\n2. Salesforce's Acquisition of Heroku\n\nEarlier this month, Salesforce bought Heroku for a staggering $212 million, giving another token of legitimacy to the growing Ruby community as well as to cloud-based programming tools.\n\nSalesforce CEO Marc Benioff said at the time, \u201cThe next era of cloud computing is social, mobile and real-time... Ruby is the language of Cloud 2, and Heroku is the leading Ruby application platform-as-a-service for Cloud 2 that is fueling this growing community. We think this acquisition will uniquely position Salesforce.com as the cornerstone for the next generation of app developers.\u201d\n\n3. Facebook's Release of HipHop for PHP\n\nIn February, Facebook rolled out HipHop, an internal open-source project intended to speed up PHP for large-scale applications.\n\nHipHop isn't quite a compiler. \"Rather,\" wrote Facebook engineer Haiping Zhao, \"it is a source code transformer. HipHop programmatically transforms your PHP source code into highly optimized C++ and then uses g++ to compile it.\"\n\nThe project was the culmination of two years of work by a small team of engineers; in the end, it got a thumbs-up from PHP creator Rasmus Lerdorf, who said, \"I think it is a cool project and it will certainly be a good option for some sites.\"\n\n4. The Rise of Node.js\n\nNode.js has been around for a couple years, but 2010 was the year awareness and use of the JavaScript framework really blew up.\n\nCommits have grown, as have the number of committers. Traffic to the project website has steadily climbed through the year, and downloads for Node.js from GitHub have predictably grown, as well.\n\nAs the organizers of the annual Node Knockout wrote, \"It\u2019s at the bleeding edge of a technology stack that allows developers to blur the lines between software, the web and the new like never before.\"\n\n5. Microsoft's Release of Visual Studio 2010\n\nThe latest version of Microsoft's Visual Studio, a big release by any standards, launched this year to impressive reviews from all corners of the web. InfoWorld said the release \"marks a major advance in functionality and ease,\" and The Register wrote, \"It is hard not to be impressed by Microsoft's tool suite.\"\n\nThe IDE was overhauled, completely rewritten from the ground up. Support for Silverlight was added, and Microsoft also took this opportunity to release F#, a new programming language developed by Microsoft Research.\n\n 6. Facebook's Release of the Open Graph API\n\nFacebook and social app developers have long wrestled with Facebook integration for third parties. In the spring at its f8 developer conference, Facebook rolled out a brand new model for tapping into the social web, and it did so to unprecedented fanfare.\n\nDubbed the Open Graph, Facebook's changes brought instant gratification and familiarity for Facebook users as they surfed the web -- and they brought a fast and easy way for devs to integrate with the social network, as easy as a single line of HTML in many cases.\n\n7. The Android/Java/Oracle Saga\n\nWhat a year it's been for Java! Not only is the language a key part in the programming stack of the fastest-growing mobile OS out there; it's also the star of a big, potentially spendy lawsuit between two of the giants of the tech industry.\n\nSun, which developed the language in-house back in the dark ages, was acquired by Oracle. That deal became official in January, and Oracle wasted no time in getting litigious with Google over that company's use of Java in the Android platform and the Dalvik virtual machine that stands in for the JVM on mobile OSes.\n\nThe lawsuit began in August with Oracle claiming that Google \"knowingly, directly and repeatedly infringed Oracle\u2019s Java-related intellectual property.\"\n\nGoogle quickly countered that it was shocked -- shocked! -- that Oracle would make such claims over an open-source technology. It followed with the assertions that Oracle's patents are unenforceable and that if there had been \u201cany use in the Android platform of any protected elements\u201d of Java, Google itself \u201cis not liable\u201d due to the fact that such violations would have been committed by third parties and without Google\u2019s knowledge.\n\nWe'll continue to keep an eye on the lawsuit and on Java's role in the Android platform throughout 2011.\n\n8. Apple Declares War on Flash\n\nTensions between Apple and Adobe ran high this year, beginning in January when the iPad launched without support for Flash. Then in February, Apple co-founder Steve Jobs told employees why: \"No one will be using Flash. The world is moving to HTML5.\"\n\nThese were the words that launched a thousand blog posts. Throughout the spring, the two companies waged a war of words -- and one sweet antitrust inquiry with the Department of Justice over Apple's banning of Flash for iPhone app devs.\n\nSteve Jobs dropped the bomb of the year in a passive-aggressive missive on Flash in which the Apple co-founder stated that Adobe's programming technology is \"no longer necessary\" and waxed hypocritical about open technologies.\n\nBut while he may have been passive aggressive and hypocritical, he also may have been right. With HTML5 making a strong showing early in its lifetime, it was only a matter of time before a public figure of Jobs's stature would make a statement or two about the death of Flash.\n\nOf course, this tension has made for a convenient cozying-up between Google and Adobe along the way.\n\nWhat Are Your Picks?\n\nAgain, let us know in the comments what your favorite stories of 2010 were -- and Happy New Year from the geeks at Mashable!\n\nWith special thanks to our Twitter friends who made suggestions for this list: Jordan Runnin, Leon Gersing and Jeremy Bray."},"shares":{"google_buzz":273,"digg":4,"facebook":324,"twitter":640,"linked_in":608,"google_plus":1,"stumble_upon":251,"total":2101},"comments_count":1,"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEyLzEyLzA0LzQ4L3RoZXRvcDh3ZWJkLmFJTi5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgk5NTB4NTM0IwplCWpwZw/0453192f/896/the-top-8-web-development-highlights-of-2010-95b218b6cc.jpg","feature_image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEyLzEyLzA0LzQ4L3RoZXRvcDh3ZWJkLmFJTi5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgkxNDM4eAplCWpwZw/3583be34/896/the-top-8-web-development-highlights-of-2010-95b218b6cc.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEyLzEyLzA0LzQ4L3RoZXRvcDh3ZWJkLmFJTi5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgkyMDB4MTE1IwplCWpwZw/6a7edef6/896/the-top-8-web-development-highlights-of-2010-95b218b6cc.jpg","query":true,"size":"200x115#"},{"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEyLzEyLzA0LzQ4L3RoZXRvcDh3ZWJkLmFJTi5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgk0MDB4MjMwIwplCWpwZw/5643f3ca/896/the-top-8-web-development-highlights-of-2010-95b218b6cc.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"400x230#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/i0goPd","choice":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{},"excerpt":"The Web Development Series is supported by Rackspace, the better way to do hosting.

By September, Google had relaunched some of Instantiations' tools as open-source software.\n\nOne of those tools was WindowBuilder, a WYSIWYG code generator. This drag-and-drop, bidirectional GUI designer for Java played nicely with a variety of frameworks, including Swing, XML Windowing Toolkit (XWT), the Standard Widget Toolkit (SWT) and more. With support for Windows, Linux and Mac, the Eclipse extension was intended to make Java app creation a lot simpler and faster.\n\nAnd CodePro is another interesting Eclipse plugin for \"comprehensive automated software code quality and security analysis.\" The toolkit included features from EclipsePro Audit and EclipsePro Test and generally attempted to improve code quality, maintenance and readability.\n\nInstatiations' execs estimate the software, which is slated to roll out with the rest of the Eclipse June 2011 release train, is worth around $5 million.\n\nGoogle's emphasis on Java tools is hardly surprising; the blockbuster success of the Android platform (and sometimes harsh criticism of the Android Market of apps) has practically mandated a focus on Java, which is a big part of the Android stack. Giving devs better Java tools free of charge is an investment in the future of Google's own platforms.\n\nThat's not to say either of these Eclipse extensions is, in itself, going to be directly used for Android applications; we're not sure either tool is intended for mobile development. But better tools make better Java devs, who in turn are better equipped to make more and better Android apps.\n\nWe would, however, love to see more drag-and-drop, WYSIWYG-plus-code Android app tools -- something along the lines of a less-dumbed-down App Inventor.

It may seem as though the Apple/Adobe war over Flash is extending to the desktop.\n\nThe initiative will first take effect on new MacBook Airs before affecting future shipments of other Macs as well. No one is precluded from installing Flash Player 10.1 themselves, however; it just means that Mac OS X will no longer ship with Flash Player already installed.\n\nUnlike Microsoft, Apple has traditionally included a version of Flash Player on both its machines and Mac OS X retail discs. This meant that users didn't have to visit adobe.com/flashplayer to enjoy their YouTube videos or adultswim.com games.\n\nApple spokesman Bill Evans told Engadget, \"We're happy to continue to support Flash on the Mac, and the best way for users to always have the most up to date and secure version is to download it directly from Adobe.\"\n\nIn the past, Apple has been criticized for including outdated versions of Flash in its OS updates. This is less of an issue when the outdated versions just don't have as many bells and whistles, but can be cause for concern when security exploits are discovered in the shipping versions.\n\nThe end user experience isn't likely to change very much -- you'll just need to download Flash on your new Mac instead of checking for the latest updated version. Still, this is a clear sign that Apple plans to continue pushing its core technologies over those produced by third parties.\n\nFor instance, Mac Rumors has also reported on Apple's decision to stop future development of its own ports of Java for Mac OS X. Again, this doesn't mean that Apple is saying developers can't use Java on the Mac, but the company will no longer maintain its own Java port.\n\nA concerned Java developer contacted Steve Jobs. Jobs responded, \"Sun (now Oracle) supplies Java for all other platforms. They have their own release schedules, which are almost always different than ours, so the Java we ship is always a version behind. This may not be the best way to do it.\"\n\nPresumably Oracle can start providing its own Mac OS X builds for Java, or community implementations of Java 6 and OpenJDK can step in. As John Gruber notes, there is a difference between Java on the server  and Java on the desktop. That doesn't mean professional Java developers won't still want to use Mac OS X to do their work.\n\nWhile Apple isn't forbidding the usage of either Flash or Java on the desktop, doing less to include consumer support out of the box makes it clear that native applications (Cocoa, Objective-C) and web standards are where Apple wants to shift its users."},"shares":{"google_buzz":41,"digg":12,"facebook":167,"google_plus":1,"linked_in":99,"twitter":1048,"total":1368},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEyLzEyLzA0LzRjL25ld21hY3Nub2xvLmQ0cy5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgk5NTB4NTM0IwplCWpwZw/77088167/2e7/new-macs-no-longer-ship-with-flash-player-24d302c8bc.jpg","feature_image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEyLzEyLzA0LzRjL25ld21hY3Nub2xvLmQ0cy5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgkxNDM4eAplCWpwZw/39f04927/2e7/new-macs-no-longer-ship-with-flash-player-24d302c8bc.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEyLzEyLzA0LzRjL25ld21hY3Nub2xvLmQ0cy5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgkyMDB4MTE1IwplCWpwZw/4b0de432/2e7/new-macs-no-longer-ship-with-flash-player-24d302c8bc.jpg","query":true,"size":"200x115#"},{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEyLzEyLzA0LzRjL25ld21hY3Nub2xvLmQ0cy5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgk0MDB4MjMwIwplCWpwZw/fc101139/2e7/new-macs-no-longer-ship-with-flash-player-24d302c8bc.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"400x230#"}],"short_url":"http://mashable.com/2010/10/22/macs-os-x-flash-playe/","choice":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{},"excerpt":"A traditional hard drive isn't the only thing missing from the brand new MacBook Air \u2014 Adobe Flash plugins are also missing from Apple's latest pint-sized creation.

That's because IBM has announced that it will be collaborating with Oracle to work on the OpenJDK project. \n\nThis means that IBM will no longer be part of the Apache Software Foundation's Project Harmony, the project that provides Android with the components it needs to run Java code. With IBM leaving the project, Harmony is basically dead in the water.\n\nAlthough Android wasn't mentioned in the announcement, this is all interrelated to the Oracle lawsuit. Google responded to the lawsuit last week, claiming that Oracle, which got Java out of its purchase of Sun Microsystems, was acting in bad faith.\n\nFor the non-Java savvy out there, here's an abbreviated rundown of how and why all of this stuff matters:\n\nApache Harmony is an open source implementation of Java. The goal in creating the project was to unite all of the various free software Java implementations together under one banner.\n\nThe project had a lot of early support, the only problem was that Sun (and then Oracle) never offered the project with a Technology Compatibility Kit (TCK). The TCK is needed to prove that Harmony is compatible with the Java specification and can be seen as a certified Java independent version of Java. When Sun first open sourced aspects of Java in 2007, it said it would provide the Apache Foundation with the necessary TCK for certification.\n\nSun never made good on those assurances and when Oracle took over Sun, the new company wasn't interested in sharing the TCKs, instead wanting to focus all of its efforts on the officially sanctioned open source Java implementation, OpenJDK.\n\nIBM's Bob Sutor discussed the decision on his blog, writing:\n\n\"We think this is the pragmatic choice. It became clear to us that first Sun and then Oracle were never planning to make the important test and certification tests for Java, the Java SE TCK, available to Apache. We disagreed with this choice, but it was not ours to make. So rather than continue to drive Harmony as an unofficial and uncertified Java effort, we decided to shift direction and put our efforts into OpenJDK. Our involvement will not be casual as we plan to hold leadership positions and, with the other members of the community, fully expect to have a strong say in how the project is managed and in which technical direction it goes.\"\n\nThis is a big blow to the Harmony project and by extension, to the libraries and classes that Android implements from Harmony in Android. Without big backing like IBM behind the project, it's not likely to survive. \n\nFor now, the Harmony implementation of Java is fine. The problem will be when future versions of Java are released and Harmony can't keep up in terms of features.\n\nIn Java, staying compatible is key. Interestingly, InfoWorld notes that Google has more developers working on OpenJDK than Oracle. So why choose Harmony for Android?\n\nWe think it's because Google wanted to do an end-run around Sun's licensing requirements. In essence, getting to take advantage of Java SE on mobile devices (something that Sun explicitly forbade without a license), but not having to pay for it. \n\nLong before Sun's sale to Oracle, others pointed out the potential licensing and IP quagmire that Google was entering with Android. The reality was, Sun didn't have the power, the funds or the industry clout to really do anything about it.\n\nOracle does. In fact, Oracle's clout and power is underscored by IBM's decision to join up. IBM may be making its decisions for pragmatic reasons, but in the decision shows that IBM is not willing to side with Google in this elongated fight.\n\nAt this point, Google's only real recourse is to sensibly settle and pay Oracle, or countersue and drag the fight out even longer. By fighting back, Google risks alienating its Java-base of developers.\n\nWhile we question how important having a strong base of Java developers really is to Android's success in the long term, it doesn't mean it's worth risking the future developments of the platform on a legal gamble.\n\nOracle is out for blood and IBM just provided the syringe."},"shares":{"google_buzz":61,"digg":9,"facebook":83,"linked_in":162,"google_plus":2,"twitter":914,"total":1231},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEyLzEyLzA0LzgyL2dvb2dsZWp1c3RsLmJOMC5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgk5NTB4NTM0IwplCWpwZw/961d3ca1/d0c/google-just-lost-a-potential-ally-in-its-legal-tussle-with-oracle-3572fb7cbc.jpg","feature_image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEyLzEyLzA0LzgyL2dvb2dsZWp1c3RsLmJOMC5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgkxNDM4eAplCWpwZw/a9c26da2/d0c/google-just-lost-a-potential-ally-in-its-legal-tussle-with-oracle-3572fb7cbc.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEyLzEyLzA0LzgyL2dvb2dsZWp1c3RsLmJOMC5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgkyMDB4MTE1IwplCWpwZw/f73f09dc/d0c/google-just-lost-a-potential-ally-in-its-legal-tussle-with-oracle-3572fb7cbc.jpg","query":true,"size":"200x115#"},{"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEyLzEyLzA0LzgyL2dvb2dsZWp1c3RsLmJOMC5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgk0MDB4MjMwIwplCWpwZw/1d12b252/d0c/google-just-lost-a-potential-ally-in-its-legal-tussle-with-oracle-3572fb7cbc.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"400x230#"}],"short_url":"http://mashable.com/2010/10/12/google-android-oracle/","choice":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{},"excerpt":"The battle between Oracle and Google over Android's use of Java just got a lot more interesting.

Learn more about Rackspace's hosting solutions here.\n\nIf you're new to programming (or new to programming in a particular language) you might be looking for an IDE -- that's an integrated development environment, the handy, dandy piece of software that acts as text editor, debugger and compiler all in one sometimes-bloated but generally useful package.\n\nUnless you're committed to working in a text editor and a command prompt window (and there are compelling reasons for doing exactly that) you might be looking for some advice on how to choose a good IDE, the pros and cons of various varieties, the relative costs (financial or system resources) of running a particular IDE, what other languages the IDE might handle well, the operating system(s) it runs on and ever so much more.\n\nI was recently in need of such advice, myself. As some of the readers of this blog know, I recently went back to school to study computer science. Being an utter novice, I made the mistake of asking developers in my sphere what IDE I should use.\n\nThe topic is apparently a minefield of catastrophic proportions. Developers are passionate, experienced and opinionated when it comes to optimizing their workflows, and recommendations (and anti-recommendations, e.g., \"NetBeans is superlatively bad and will turn your hardware into Cream O' Wheat!\") fly like shells over a battlefield.\n\nHere's a less opinionated, concise but thorough look at IDEs for the new programmer. If you need more detailed information or want to find an IDE for a less common programming language, check out the Wikipedia article comparing just about every IDE known to humankind.\n\nAnd if we left out an IDE you particularly love, let us know about it in the comments -- but try to keep the NetBeans/Eclipse, Vim/Emacs flamewars to a minimum.\n\nIDEs Built from Text Editors\n\nIt's a slightly more complicated setup, but some pro developers swear by these workflows, which take a lightweight, run-of-the-mill text editor and turn it into a full-fledged, be-all-end-all IDE.\n\nArs Technica has an excellent step-by-step article on how to turn Vim into a great IDE using Exuberant Ctags, completion modules, script collections and more.\n\nEmacs users can also use commands to make this editor more developer-friendly. And of course, this topic gets a thorough discussion at StackOverflow.\n\nWhen in doubt, search Google for tips on turning your favorite text editor into a great IDE for your language of choice. Chances are someone, somewhere has already attempted it and is willing to hand out advice.\n\nMulti-Language IDEs\n\nAs a beginning programmer, you might not need tools for coding in Ruby and Python and C++ and PHP, but if you're aiming for a multi-language career later on, you might consider learning the ropes of a multi-language IDE.\n\nOne kind gent (or lady) on Hacker News wrote, \"Although many IDEs can handle more than one language, few do it well. Plus, it's likely overkill if you are just getting started.\" This individual suggested instead using a simple text editor such as gEdit (Linux) or TextMate (Mac) for multi-language practice.\n\nEclipse\r\nLanguages: C, C++, Python, Perl, PHP, Java, Ruby and more\r\nPrice: FREE\n\nEclipse is the free and open-source editor upon which many development frameworks are based. It's one of the granddaddies in its field and comes highly recommended by many a professional developer. Eclipse began as a Java development environment and has greatly expanded through a system of lightweight plugins.\n\nNetBeans\r\nLanguages: Java, JavaScript, PHP, Python, Ruby, C, C++ and more\r\nPrice: FREE\n\nNetBeans is neck-and-neck with Eclipse as the most-recommended IDE in this category. It's free and open-source, supports tons of languages with more plugins coming all the time, and is incredibly simple to install and use, even for a beginner.\n\nKomodo\r\nLanguages: Perl, Python, Tcl, PHP, Ruby, Javascript and more\r\nPrice: $295\n\nThis enterprise-level tool might be best for the pro developer because of its higher price point. For beginners, you might also want to check out the Komodo-based, FOSS editor Open Komodo or Komodo's FOSS version, Komodo Edit.\n\nAptana\r\nLanguages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, AJAX and others via plugins\r\nPrice: FREE\n\nAptana is a popular choice for web app development. Aptana Studio 2 can be used as a stand-alone IDE or can be plugged into Eclipse. Aptana comes with Firebug support built-in, and its developer community seems to release plugins for other languages as needed.\n\nBlackAdder\r\nLanguages: Python and Ruby\r\nPrice: $59.99 (personal developer license)\n\nThis IDE is designed for Python and Ruby devs creating apps for Windows and Linux. It includes a text editor as well as a GUI designer that uses pyQT and QT Designer. The makers of BlackAdder allow you to test drive the IDE in a limited demo version.\n\nGeany\r\nLanguages: C, Java, PHP, HTML, Python, Perl, Pascal and a boatload more\r\nPrice: FREE\n\nGeany bills itself as a \"small and fast\" IDE, but it is by no means a lightweight. Its list of supported languages is about a block long; it's highly customizable; and it features a robust set of plugins which is open for hacking.\n\nHere's a chart showing the differences and similarities between a few multi-language IDEs. An asterisk denotes the need to use a third-party or other plugin to achieve the desired functionality. The .NET column indicates support for .NET languages, particularly C#. \"FOSS\" is the acronym for \"free and open-source.\" Click the image to see a slightly larger version.\n\nIDEs for Mobile Development\n\nThese days, developing mobile applications is one of the most compelling and exciting reasons for learning how to code. We're still looking for that perfect, all-in-one, cross-platform mobile app IDE -- in fact, we particularly welcome your comments and suggestions on this score -- but here are a few ideas to get you started.\n\nTry some of PhoneGap's cross-platform tools. PhoneGap works with Xcode and Eclipse for iPhone and Android, respectively. You could also try the web-based, hosted RhoHub, which allows for git-powered source control and team collaboration.\n\nAnother good bet for mobile developers is Appcelerator's Titanium Mobile, which lets you write in any language/IDE you choose, then translates your code to Objective-C or Java. You can also check out our list of cross-platform mobile development tools. Finally, the mobile development products (and resultant applications) from Adobe are getting more interesting all the time -- we highly recommend keeping an eye on their developer tools.\n\nAlso, if you're already using a multi-language or other IDE, check the web to see if a mobile-development plugin already exists; many IDEs such as Eclipse have this functionality.\n\nWeb-Based IDEs\n\nIf you're working remotely or need a last-minute fix, these IDEs might be worth looking into.\n\nCodeRun\r\nLanguages: ASP.NET, PHP, Ajax, C#, JavaScript, CSS, HTML and more\r\nPrice: FREE\n\nThis broswer-based IDE works in Chrome, Firefox, Safari and even good old Internet Explorer. Like the more robust multi-language IDEs, CodeRun supports Visual Studio projects and .NET languages. Best of all, your code is sharable via hyperlinks; it's even got built-in social sharing tools, should you want to tweet your code.\n\nShiftEdit\r\nLanguages: PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript\r\nPrice: FREE\n\nShiftEdit brings revision history and code snippets to the browser. Any files you access will stored until next time you log in. This IDE's text editor is based on Mozilla's Bespin (mentioned below).\n\nIf you need a collaborative, web-based code editor -- great when working on joint projects or as part of a team -- you might also want to check out Squad. And for HTML5-based code editing, try Mozilla's SkyWriter, formerly codenamed Bespin.\n\nIDEs for Microsoft/.NET/C# and Apple/iPhone/Mac Devs\n\nSome languages require a bit of special handling; not all multi-language IDEs support all languages, and if you're working with the Cocoa API, for example, or with a .NET framework language, you might want to consider something more specifically suited to a Microsoft or Apple development environment.\n\nAnother part of this category includes single-platform IDEs such as Coda and Espresso. They only run on Mac Operating Systems, but they allow for multi-language development within a very Apple-flavored GUI.\n\nVisual Studio\r\nLanguages: Visual C++, VB.NET, C#, F# and others\r\nPrice: $549\n\nVisual Studio is Microsoft's IDE. If you're building Silverlight apps or planning on working in a .NET shop (such as MySpace), you may want to spend some time with Visual Studio. Visual Basic has some support for non-Microsoft languages such as Python and Ruby, but you'll have to install those services yourself. A free, limited-time trial version is available.\n\nXcode\r\nLanguages: Objective-C, Objective-C 2, Cocoa and Cocoa Touch APIs\r\nPrice: FREE\n\nThis IDE is just for creating iOS and Mac apps. If you're thinking along Apple-y lines and want to get into iPhone or iPad development, Xcode might be your first stop. This IDE includes an iPhone simulator and GUI builder, too.\n\nMonodevelop\r\nLanguages: C/C++, Visual Basic, C# and other .NET languages\r\nPrice: FREE\n\nMonodevelop is a good option if you're working in a .NET languages and don't want (or need) to fork over the $550 for Visual Studio. This free-as-in-beer IDE also allows you to port your apps to Linux while maintaining a single codebase.\n\nEspresso\r\nLanguages: HTML, CSS, XML, JavaScript and PHP\r\nPrice: $79.95\n\nEspresso, a tool for Mac web devs, comes from the makers of CSSEdit. Its supported languages and other features are extensible through plugins known as \"Sugars.\"\n\nCoda\r\nLanguages: PHP, JavaScript, CSS, HTML, AppleScript and Cocoa API\r\nPrice: $99\n\nCoda bills itself as \"one-window development\" for the Mac user, and its a favorite of many developers on this platform. It's a full-featured IDE, but one of its most interesting features is live collaboration with other users.\n\nIt's not delirium tremens; it's just an elePHPant.\n\nIDEs for Specific Languages\n\nHere are a few suggestions for IDEs that cater to developers working in a single language. Some of these options are more costly than others, but most of the non-free IDEs here will also have a free trial version available for you to test-drive the software, learn to use it and decide whether or not you need and want its features and interface.\n\nWe only have space to highlight a few of the more popular programming languages here. If we left your preferred language out of this list, search StackOverflow for IDE recommendations, or ping the friendly devs over at Hacker News for their advice.\n\nC/C++\n\nC/C++ languages are some of the most widely used in the world of computer programming. Almost every multi-language IDE will support C/C++, but here are some dedicated IDEs just for C programmers.\n\nBloodshed Dev-C++\r\nPrice: FREE\n\nCode::Blocks\r\nPrice: FREE\n\nCodeLite\r\nPrice: FREE\n\nC-Free\r\nPrice: $79.95 (single-user license)\n\nJava\n\nYeah, yeah, I've heard about how much Java sucks more times than I can recall. But it's used in the Android stack as well as in a lot of intro-level programming courses, so here's a lineup of good Java IDEs.\n\nJikes\r\nPrice: FREE\n\nJcreator\r\nPrice: $89 (single-user license)\n\nIntelliJ IDEA\r\nPrice: FREE\n\nPython\n\nNever mind the fu and bar, here's some spam and eggs. If you got that reference, you might want to check out these links. Here are a few IDEs dedicated to Python, a powerful, readable and fascinating language. For more suggestions and comparison information, check out this exhaustive StackOverflow list of Python IDEs.\n\nIdle\r\nPrice: FREE\n\nPyCharm\r\nPrice: $49 (personal license)\n\nPida\r\nPrice: FREE\n\nWing\r\nPrice: $35 (personal license, single OS)\n\nPyscripter\r\nPrice: FREE\n\nPHP\n\nPHP powers some of the most ubiquitous web apps around today, from WordPress to Facebook. Many of the free multi-language IDEs also support PHP development. Here are some full-featured, pro IDEs we've seen recommended.\n\nPHPStorm\r\nPrice: $99 (personal license)\n\nPhpED\r\nPrice: $119\n\nZend Studio\r\nPrice: $399\n\nPHP Designer\r\nPrice: $45 (personal license)\n\nRuby/Rails\n\nFor a relatively young language, Ruby gets a lot of mileage, from consumer-facing apps like Twitter to dev-centric sites such as GitHub. In addition to these IDEs, also check out Ruby In Steel, a Ruby tool for Visual Studio, and Heroku, the so-hot-right-now PaaS for Ruby apps.\n\nRubyMine\r\nPrice: $99 (commercial license)\n\nRedcar\r\nPrice: FREE (and still under development)\n\nRadRails\r\nPrice: FREE\n\nUse What You Love, Love What You Use\n\nFinally, after scores of links and a huge data-dump of information, we can only tell you this: Developers are passionate and opinionated about their IDEs because each individual has researched, chosen, used and come to appreciate a specific IDE (or set of IDEs) for personal as well as practical reasons.\n\nWe recommend you try out a few of the free (and free trial) IDEs before making a hard and fast choice as to what you'll use, but you should ultimately use the IDE that suits you best and makes you happiest. Anyone else's recommendations are just highly subjective suggestions.\n\nWe wish you well, and happy coding!\n\nDisclosure: The author of this post uses gEdit, Notepad, NetBeans, JCreator, and a magnetic needle and a steady hand.\n\nSeries supported by Rackspace\n\nThe Web Development Series is supported by Rackspace, the better way to do hosting.

We will strongly defend open-source standards and will continue to work with the industry to develop the Android platform.\u201d\r\nThe lawsuit focuses around the Java platform, which Oracle acquired when it bought Sun Microsystems earlier this year.\u00a0 Oracle's argument is rather straightforward: Google \"directly and repeatedly infringed Oracle's Java-related intellectual property\" by utilizing it in the Android operating system and the Android SDK.\u00a0 In addition to patent issues, the suit also claims Java is \"copyrightable\" rather than strictly FOSS and accuses Google of copyright infringement for using Java's code without any license.\r\nGoogle's response to the lawsuit doesn't come as a surprise; any concession even insinuating that it did anything wrong could cost the company millions in either a judgment or a settlement.\u00a0 It's likely Google will argue that it's not committing patent infringement because Java is an open-source software; Google mentioned open-source standards not once, but three times in its statement.\u00a0 Sun released most of Java's code as open-source software in 2006.\r\nWhy is this lawsuit only being filed now, three years after Android's introduction?\u00a0 It has a lot to do with the high cost of patent lawsuits; they take millions in research and legal fees, not to mention it takes a significant amount of a company's time to pursue a patent lawsuit.\u00a0 As CNet points out, Sun Microsystems didn't have the financial capability to wage war against Google.\u00a0 Oracle, with its greater financial strength and experience in patent lawsuits, can.\u00a0 And while the suit could cost Oracle millions, the payout would be even greater if it can show that Google willfully infringed on Oracle's Java-related patents."},"shares":{"google_buzz":83,"digg":1,"facebook":65,"twitter":977,"stumble_upon":83,"total":1209},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEyLzEyLzA0LzQ1L2dvb2dsZXJlYnV0LmR4eS5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgk5NTB4NTM0IwplCWpwZw/48780280/828/google-rebuts-oracle-lawsuit-invokes-open-source-defense-de36366680.jpg","feature_image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEyLzEyLzA0LzQ1L2dvb2dsZXJlYnV0LmR4eS5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgkxNDM4eAplCWpwZw/634b2d7d/828/google-rebuts-oracle-lawsuit-invokes-open-source-defense-de36366680.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEyLzEyLzA0LzQ1L2dvb2dsZXJlYnV0LmR4eS5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgkyMDB4MTE1IwplCWpwZw/04024ff9/828/google-rebuts-oracle-lawsuit-invokes-open-source-defense-de36366680.jpg","query":true,"size":"200x115#"},{"image":"http://rack.2.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDEyLzEyLzA0LzQ1L2dvb2dsZXJlYnV0LmR4eS5qcGcKcAl0aHVtYgk0MDB4MjMwIwplCWpwZw/f74a275e/828/google-rebuts-oracle-lawsuit-invokes-open-source-defense-de36366680.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"400x230#"}],"short_url":"http://mashable.com/2010/08/14/google-rebuts-oracle-lawsuit-invokes-open-source-defense/","choice":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{},"excerpt":"Hours after Oracle filed suit against Google for patent infringement, Google has made it very clear that it will stand its ground. \"We are disappointed Oracle has chosen to attack both Google and the open-source Java community with this baseless laws...","channel":"Social Media","channel_link":"http://mashable.com/social-media/"},{"_id":"4d38feb55198402dfd000c0c","id":"2010/06/25/java-movie-trailer","title":"Java: The Movie!
