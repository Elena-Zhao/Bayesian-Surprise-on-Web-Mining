In the Bizarro world of Oracle, unsigned applets are treated as more dangerous than signed applets. 	This is backwards for two reasons. First, unsigned applets run in a restricted Java sandbox whereas signed applets are given unrestricted access	to the system. Yes, the sandbox has been buggy and broken, but some security is better than none. Second, it shows a faith in the Certificate     Authority system that is unwarranted.<br /><br /> 		As of <b>Oct 2014</b> and Java 7 Update 71 and Java 8 Update 25, the applet above can be run with Java set to the default "high" security level.	There will be assorted <i>"as you sure"</i> type prompts both from Java and your web browser, but it will run. However, this site, javatester.org, 	needs to first be added to the "Exception Site List" using the Java Control Panel. When <a 	href="https://www.java.com/en/download/faq/exception_sitelist.xml">adding sites to the list</a>, you have to 	prefix them with HTTP colon slash slash. Java will object to HTTP but it will accept it. There is no HTTPS version of this site. Also, if 	you add "javatester.org" to the list, you must then go to "javatester.org" as "www.javatester.org" will fail. <br />	Because it is unsigned, this applet will not run with Java set to the "very high" security level. 	</td></tr>  <tr><td style="background-color:#CEF2E0;  color:black; line-height:170%; border-bottom:6px solid white;     padding:8px; "><b>NEW SECURITY IN JAVA 7 UPDATE 51: </b> January 27, 2014. <br />	Update 51 changed the default security rules for unsigned     Java applets such as the one on this page. By default, Java no longer runs any unsigned applets.  In the Java 	control panel, the default security level with Update 51 is "High" which Oracle describes as "Java applications identified by a 	certificate from a trusted authority will be allowed to run".  What this does not say is that unsigned applets will not run, at least 	not by default. If you get an error on this page that says <b>"Application blocked by security settings"</b> this is probably why. 	<br /><br />	One way to run an unsigned applet is to lower the security level to "Medium". The other way is to add trusted 	websites to a new exception list that Oracle/Java maintains. This list is not to be confused with the list of trusted applets     that Firefox or Chrome maintains. Yes, there are now three lists of applets that are naughty and nice. </td></tr>     <!-- 	If the Java 7 security level (only tested on Windows 7) is set to "Very High" then no unsigned Java applets (Java programs inside a web page) are allowed to execute. The applet on this page is unsigned. The error message is "Application Blocked by Security Settings ... Your security settings have blocked an untrusted application from running". Oracle has made multiple mistakes in this single error message. 	 (1) The message says nothing about Java, a huge oversight (2) The message refers to an "application" without being clear that it really means a Java program. (3) The message refers to an "untrusted" application when it really is describing an unsigned application. You can trust some signed Java programs and not trust others. Heck, Java itself asks before running signed applets even with security set low. An amazing level of incompetence for a single error message. -->	   <tr><td style="background-color:#CEF2E0;  color:black; line-height:170%; border-bottom:6px solid white;     padding:8px; "><b>YOUR BROWSER LIES: </b>Java 7 Update 10 introduced a new checkbox that disables the use of Java in all browsers. By and large, this is a good thing, but there seems to be a failure to communicate between Java and many web browsers. As a result, all the browsers I have tried so far incorrectly report that Java is not installed when, in fact,  it may be installed but this new security feature has been enabled. <br>As of Java 7 Update 71 and Java 8 Update 25 this is still true on Windows machines. Interestingly, if Java is disabled system-wide for use in   web browsers (its on the Security) tab, both Chrome and Firefox will not even show the Java plug-in as being installed. On the flip side,  Firefox 33 on Windows 7 reports that "Browser has Java disabled" when Java is not installed. </td></tr>  <tr><td style="background-color:#CEF2E0; font-weight:bold; line-height:200%;">&nbsp; JAVA VERSION HISTORY    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_version_history">Wikipedia</a> has this too)</td></tr><!--   JAVA 7   HISTORY  -->  <tr><td style="background-color:#E6FFF2; line-height:200%;">&nbsp;<b>Java 7</b> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  (a.k.a version 1.7.x)   <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Java 7 was the default for new installations from May 31, 2012 until Oct. 14, 2014 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Java 7 users will be auto-updated to Java 8 in early 2015 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;See the official Oracle <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/7u-relnotes-515228.html">Release      history</a> for Java 7</td></tr>		   <tr><td style="background-color:#F5FFFA; padding-right:20px; line-height:160%;"><ul><li>As of Oct 14, 2014 the latest version of Java 7 is  a tie!    <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;For the first time, there are two latest versions,         <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/7u71-relnotes-2296187.html">Update 71</a>  and         <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/7u72-relnotes-2296190.html">Update 72</a>.	<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;They have the same security related bug fixes but Update 72 includes &quot;additional <a 	      href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/2col/7u72-bugfixes-2298229.html">non-critical stability fixes</a>&quot;.     <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;Version 71 is <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/java-platform-group/entry/upcoming_oracle_java_se_7u72">intended 	         for most users</a>. 	<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;The Security Baseline is Update 71.

For whatever reason,     Java on the Mac was maintained by Apple, while Java on Windows, Linux and Solaris came from Oracle     (previously from Sun).      Apple was frequently late in releasing the latest versions of Java for OS X leaving Mac users exposed to    known  flaws.<br><br>    Around August 2012, this changed. While Java version 6 for OS X still comes from Apple exclusively,      Java version 7 is available from Oracle to users running Lion and Mountain Lion. What has not changed      is that Apple is still late in delivering updates. Java 6 Update 38 was released by Oracle for Windows in      the middle of Dec. 2012. This was written a month later and Apple has still not released Update 38 for OS X.      <br><br>      Oracle has some <a href="http://www.java.com/en/download/mac_sysreq-sm.jsp">technical     restrictions</a> for Java 7 running on OS X. First off, Java 7 is only available on an "Intel-based Mac running      Mac OS X 10.7.3 (Lion) or later". In addition, Java 7 is not available for Chrome because it only supports 64     bit browsers on OS X. Safari and Firefox are supported. In addition, Oracle notes that "installing Java on a Mac is     performed on a system wide basis, for all users, and administrator privileges are required. You cannot install Java    on a single-user basis."
