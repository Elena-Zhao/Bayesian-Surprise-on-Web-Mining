Please try it out from head of the main source code repository: https://svn.java.net/svn/javacc~svn or svn+ssh://&lt;your java.net userid&gt;@svn.java.net/javacc~svn. Just check out the source code and run ant to build it. We will soon release a beta version.<p><p>Java Compiler Compiler <sup>tm</sup> (JavaCC <sup>tm</sup>) is the most popular parsergenerator for use with Java <sup>tm</sup> applications.  A parser generator is atool that reads a grammar specification and converts it to a Javaprogram that can recognize matches to the grammar.  In addition tothe parser generator itself, JavaCC provides other standard capabilitiesrelated to parser generation such as tree building (via a toolcalled JJTree included with JavaCC), actions,debugging, etc.</p><p>We've had hundreds of thousands of downloads and estimate serioususers in the many thousands (and maybe even tens of thousands).  Ournewsgroup <strong>comp.compilers.tools.javacc</strong> and our <ahref="http://java.net/projects/javacc/lists">mailing list</a> together have a few thousandparticipants.</p><p>JavaCC works with any Java VM version 1.2 or greater.  It has beencertified to be 100% Pure Java.  JavaCC has been tested on countlessdifferent platforms without any special porting requirements.  Giventhat we have seen JavaCC run on only around 5 or 6 platforms, we thinkthis is a great testimonial to the "Write Once Run Anywhere" aspect ofthe Java programming language.  We say this as engineers who have personally experienced thebenefits of writing Java applications.</p><hr /><h2>Getting the Software</h2><p>Download <a href="https://java.net/projects/javacc/downloads/download/javacc-6.0.zip">JavaCC 6.0</a> (older versions are <a href="http://java.net/projects/javacc/downloads">here</a>).</p><h3>Third party contributions</h3><p>An excellent <ahref="http://www.engr.mun.ca/~theo/JavaCC-FAQ/">FAQ</a> is maintainedby Theo Norvell at Memorial University of Newfoundland.</p><p>A <a href="http://java.net/projects/javacc/downloads/directory/contrib/grammars">repository ofJavaCC grammars</a> is being maintained on the JavaCC home page.
