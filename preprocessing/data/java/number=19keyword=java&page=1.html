It is not supported in iOS or Chrome OS. Java is very much involved in Android, but not in a way that is visible to end users.</p><p>Java is used both online and offline in Windows, OS X and Linux. The online use involves Java programs, typically referred to as "applets", embedded in a web page. All the security issues regarding Java involve applets. Offline, Java is used by applications installed in your operating system. Examples of these applications are below in the "Do you need Java" section. The topic of Java being used in a web browser vs. an installed application was addressed by Steve Gibson on the <a  href="http://www.grc.com/sn/sn-387.htm">Jan 16, 2013 edition</a> of his Security Now podcast (do a find for "Jared").</p><p>A component of Java has to be installed on a computer before Java programs can execute, either online or offline. This component has a couple names. It was initially referred to as the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), but now the more common term is JRE (Java Runtime Environment). Sometimes, it is just referred to as Java, which is a big misnomer as there are many parts to the Java ecosystem.</p><p>The latest edition of Java is version 7. It comes from Oracle and is supported on Windows, OS X and Linux. Oracle gave up issuing bug fixes for Java version 6 in the middle of 2013 (for free that is; you can pay Oracle for Java 6 bug fixes). Apple continues to issues bug fixes for Java 6 on Snow Leopard, Lion and Mountain Lion.</p> <p>On Windows, the Java runtime (JRE) may or may not be pre-installed, the decision is left up to the hardware manufacturer. A Java version 6 runtime was pre-installed by Apple on OS X Leopard and Snow Leopard, but starting with Lion, Apple stopped pre-installing Java. Java 6 can be installed on Lion and Mountain Lion, but it will not run applets. Java 7 can be installed on Lion and Mountain Lion to run applets. Java 7 can not be installed on Snow Leopard. Lion and Mountain can have both Java 6 and Java 7 installed concurrently.</p><p>The Java runtime (JRE) on Windows comes from Oracle (previously from Sun). On OS X, Apple supplies the JRE for Java version 6, while Oracle supplies the JRE for Java version 7. Oracle is the official supplier of the JRE for Linux, but there are also other sources available. Microsoft used to maintain their own JRE on Windows but that fell by the wayside long ago. In the old days Netscape had their own JRE as did IBM and others.</p><p>Just because a Java runtime is installed, does not mean that a web browser will actually use it. There are three possible reasons for this: <ol><li>The use of Java may be disabled in any one browser. The only exception here is Internet Explorer which, despite what you may read online, is not capable of totally severing its connection to Java.<br><br></li><li>Starting with Java 7 Update 10, the use of Java online by <i>all installed web browsers</i> can be disabled with a new checkbox in the security section of the Java Control Panel. To date, my experience has been that while this works, web browsers <i>incorrectly</i> report that Java is not installed at all.<br><br></li><li>The web browser may be architecturally unable to run Java. One example of this is Chrome on OS X Lion and Mountain when Java 7 is installed (it is a 32 bit vs. 64 bit issue). Another example is the tile world version of Internet Explorer 10 on Windows 8 which does not support <i>any</i> plug-ins. <br><br></li><li>Apple may not allow it. On OS X systems (Snow Leopard, Lion and Mountain Lion) the XProtect feature has been used by Apple to prevent Java from running in Safari (not sure of other browsers, I've read conflicting information). To see this in Lion and Mountain Lion, go to  System Preferences -> Security section -> Advanced button. There should be a checkbox to "Automatically update safe downloads list".</li></ol>  <p>Currently Java has a poor reputation for an endless stream of security flaws. But well before this, Apple and Microsoft did not like Java because it made their operating systems less important. A Java program can, in theory, run equally well on Windows, OS X and Linux. And, that's just for starters. As long as there is a JRE for an operating system, Java programs can run on that system. This opens up other environments too, such as IBM mainframes and Unix. The popular phrase, in the early days of Java was "write once, run anywhere". But, it all went wrong, well before security flaws became the main Java story. </p> <p>As it played out over the years, Flash beat out Java in the marketplace on the client side (your computer). Flash served the same cross platform needs that Java was intended for. There were annoying differences between Java runtimes from different vendors which led to the sarcastic phrase  "write once, debug everywhere." It may be that Flash won out simply because there was only one source (Adobe now, Macromedia initially) for its runtime environment. On the server side however, Java has always been popular.</p> <p>Java programs are prepared for execution in the JVM/JRE by being translated into something called Java bytecode. The Java Runtime Environment doesn't really care about, or deal with, the Java programming language, it takes Java bytecode as input. This, along with assorted advantages to using a JVM, has led to other programming languages also being translated into Java bytecode so that they can be run in a Java Virtual Machine. In Sept. 2013 <a  href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2013/09/the-second-coming-of-java/">Wired reported</a> on two such popular  languages, Clojure and Scala. A version of Ruby known as JRuby also runs in a JVM. Wired reported that Twitter runs entirely inside JVMs mostly using software written in Scala but also some written in Java. LinkedIn is also married to JVMs and uses a mixture of Java and Scala.</p><p>Now that security flaws are the big issue with Java, the safest best practice is to un-install Java and see if anything breaks. I say this because, as far as I know, there is no inventory function that reports on Java usage system-wide.  Since all the security issues have been with Java applets embedded in web pages, someone that only needs Java for installed applications, should disable its use in all browsers using a security feature first introduced in Java 7 Update 10  <a  href="http://www.java.com/en/download/help/disable_browser.xml">(see Oracle&quot;s instructions)</a>. Someone needing to run Java applets should normally use a web browser that has Java disabled and use a second browser, with Java enabled, exclusively on the site(s) that need Java. If you are not sure which sites use Java, Google's Chrome browser is your friend, as it warns before running Java applets.</p> <p>The <a href="version.html">Version</a> page of this site verifies that a browser is capable   of running Java applets in web pages by running a very simple applet that displays the   version of Java. It also has a history of Java releases and instructions for disabling Java in assorted browsers.   The source code for the applet is on the <a href="about.html">About</a> page.</p>  <p>Java applets can, optionally, be digitally signed. Those that are not, started generating a new pop-up warning with the introduction of Java 7 Update 11. The "version" applet on this site is not signed. Neither are  those from Oracle that test if Java is working (<a href="http://java.com/en/download/testjava.jsp">here</a>  and <a href="http://java.com/en/download/installed.jsp">here</a>). </p> <p>Finally, you may see Oracle mention the Java security baseline. This refers to the latest version of Java that contains no security flaws. This is not necessarily the latest version. There is a different security baseline edition for Java 6 and 7. To illustrate, as of mid-January 2013, Update 37 was the security baseline edition for Java 6. Windows users had access to Update 38 which contained bug fixes, but no security related bug fixes. Apple did not produce an Update 38 for the Mac, they maxed out at Update 37.</p> <!--<p>There can be multiple versions of Java installed on a computer.   Somewhere in the lifespan of Java version 6 (I think it was Update 10) Sun added the ability for   new versions of Java to remove older versions. However, this didn't go all the way back.   That is, very early versions of Java 6 may not be automatically removed, neither are versions   of Java 5. So, a computer with more than one web browser can have each browser using a different   version of Java, or one browser enabled for Java and another not.</p> -->     <h3>&nbsp;My Blogs</h3>I have written about Java a few times in my Defensive Computing blog at Computerworld. <ul style="line-height:160%;"><li><a href="http://www.computerworld.com/article/2841829/whats-new-with-java.html">What&#39;s  new with Java</a> October 31, 2014.

That's the term I use on this site because it was created long ago. Now however, things are more complicated. <a  href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/jweb/client-security.html">According to Oracle</a>,  Java programs running inside a browser "includes plugin applets, Java Web Start applications, embedded JavaFX applications, and access to the native deployment toolkit plugins". </p> <p>Windows users may find the term <i>applet</i> used to describe the small applications in the Control Panel (Power Options, Mouse options, Administrative Tools, etc.).  These control panel thingies have nothing to do with Java, other than the Java one, which is referred to as the Java Control Panel.</p><p>Java applets can be digitally signed. Those that are not are referred to as "unsigned", "untrusted" and  "sandboxed". </p><p><b>JavaScript</b> is separate and distinct from Java. No relationship at all. </p><!-- Some web pages create JavaScript errors when loading. This is likely due a coding errorin the web page being viewed. JavaScript errors have nothing to do with Java at all.<p>When referring to Java in the context of a web browserrunning applets (Java programs in a web page), we are really speaking about theJava run-time environment used by the web browser to run the applets. Therun-time environment is called a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) by its creator, SunMicrosystems. The folks at the Mozilla project refer to it as the Java Run TimeEnvironment (JRE). Microsoft calls it a VM (for Virtual Machine) probablybecause they don't want to mention &quot;Java&quot;. Don't confuse the&quot;VM&quot; Microsoft refers to with VM products from VMware, Connectix and IBM.These products have nothing to do with Java.--></div><iframe width="100%" height="20" frameborder="0" marginwidth="2" marginheight="2" class="screenonly"        scrolling=no src="jtfooter/footer.php">     Your web browser does not support iFrames, so you can not see the page counters </iframe><div class="printonly"><hr size="2"></div><div class="footer">   <div style="background-color:#FFF1E6; color:#BF5003; padding:3px;">   Website created and maintained by <a href="http://www.michaelhorowitz.com" style="text-decoration:none;"   class="head">Michael Horowitz</a> &nbsp; &nbsp;  mh _at_ javatester.org &nbsp; &nbsp;   <a class="head" style="text-decoration:none;" href="jtfooter/jtstatsdisplay.php"   target="_blank">site stats</a>  <br>    Java and JavaScript are trademarks of Oracle in the US and other countries.
