What will our place in history be? Like so much of the American story, once again, we face a choice. Once again, there are those who believe that there isn’t much we can do about this as a nation. That the best idea is to give everyone one big refund on their government—divvy it up by individual portions, in the form of tax breaks, hand it out, and encourage everyone to use their share to go buy their own health care, their own retirement plan, their own child care, their own education, and so on. In Washington, they call this the Ownership Society. But in our past there has been another term for it—Social Darwinism—every man or woman for him or herself. It’s a tempting idea, because it doesn’t require much thought or ingenuity. It allows us to say that those whose health care or tuition may rise faster than they can afford—tough luck. It allows us to say to the Maytag workers who have lost their job—life isn’t fair. It let’s us say to the child who was born into poverty—pull yourself up by your bootstraps. And it is especially tempting because each of us believes we will always be the winner in life’s lottery, that we’re the one who will be the next Donald Trump, or at least we won’t be the chump who Donald Trump says: “You’re fired!” But there is a problem. It won’t work. It ignores our history. It ignores the fact that it’s been government research and investment that made the railways possible and the internet possible. It’s been the creation of a massive middle class, through decent wages and benefits and public schools that allowed us all to prosper. Our economic dependence depended on individual initiative. It depended on a belief in the free market; but it has also depended on our sense of mutual regard for each other, the idea that everybody has a stake in the country, that we’re all in it together and everybody’s got a shot at opportunity. That’s what’s produced our unrivaled political stability.<ul><li>Knox College Commencement Address (4 June 2005).</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Focusing your life solely on making a buck shows a certain poverty of ambition.

What did this man do?" How might I answer them? Unlike the others commemorated in this place, Dr. <a href="/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr." title="Martin Luther King Jr." class="mw-redirect">Martin Luther King Jr.</a> was not a president of the United States — at no time in his life did he hold public office. He was not a hero of foreign wars. He never had much money, and while he lived he was reviled at least as much as he was celebrated. By his own accounts, he was a man frequently racked with doubt, a man not without flaws, a man who, like <a href="/wiki/Moses" title="Moses">Moses</a> before him, more than once questioned why he had been chosen for so arduous a task — the task of leading a people to freedom, the task of healing the festering wounds of a nation's original sin. And yet lead a nation he did. Through words he gave voice to the voiceless. Through deeds he gave courage to the faint of heart. By dint of vision, and determination, and most of all faith in the redeeming power of love, he endured the humiliation of arrest, the loneliness of a prison cell, the constant threats to his life, until he finally inspired a nation to transform itself, and begin to live up to the meaning of its creed.<br />Like Moses before him, he would never live to see the Promised Land. But from the mountain top, he pointed the way for us — a land no longer torn asunder with racial hatred and ethnic strife, a land that measured itself by how it treats the least of these, a land in which strength is defined not simply by the capacity to wage war but by the determination to forge peace — a land in which all of God's children might come together in a spirit of brotherhood.<br />We have not yet arrived at this longed for place. For all the progress we have made, there are times when the land of our dreams recedes from us — when we are lost, wandering spirits, content with our suspicions and our angers, our long-held grudges and petty disputes, our frantic diversions and tribal allegiances. And yet, by erecting this monument, we are reminded that this different, better place beckons us, and that we will find it not across distant hills or within some hidden valley, but rather we will find it somewhere in our hearts.<ul><li>Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. National Memorial Groundbreaking Ceremony (13 November 2006).</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Throughout American history, there have been moments that call on us to meet the challenges of an uncertain world, and pay whatever price is required to secure our freedom. They are the soul-trying times our forbearers spoke of, when the ease of complacency and self-interest must give way to the more difficult task of rendering judgment on what is best for the nation and for posterity, and then acting on that judgment — making the hard choices and sacrifices necessary to uphold our most deeply held values and ideals. This was true for those who went to Lexington and Concord. It was true for those who lie buried at Gettysburg. It was true for those who built democracy’s arsenal to vanquish fascism, and who then built a series of alliances and a world order that would ultimately defeat communism. And this has been true for those of us who looked on the rubble and ashes of 9/11, and made a solemn pledge that such an atrocity would never again happen on United States soil; that we would do whatever it took to hunt down those responsible, and use every tool at our disposal – diplomatic, economic, and military — to root out both the agents of terrorism and the conditions that helped breed it.<ul><li>"A Way Forward in Iraq", Remarks to the Chicago Council on Global Affairs (20 November 2006).</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>We cannot afford to be a country of isolationists right now. 9/11 showed us that try as we might to ignore the rest of the world, our enemies will no longer ignore us. And so we need to maintain a strong foreign policy, relentless in pursuing our enemies and hopeful in promoting our values around the world. But to guard against isolationist sentiments in this country, we must change conditions in Iraq and the policy that has characterized our time there – a policy based on blind hope and ideology instead of fact and reality.<br />Americans called for this more serious policy a few Tuesdays ago. It’s time that we listen to their concerns and win back their trust. I spoke here a year ago and delivered a message about Iraq that was similar to the one I did today. I refuse to accept the possibility that I will have to come back a year from now and say the same thing. There have been too many speeches. There have been too many excuses. There have been too many flag-draped coffins, and there have been too many heartbroken families. The time for waiting in Iraq is over. It is time to change our policy. It is time to give Iraqis their country back.

We have been told we would be greeted as liberators. We have been promised the insurgency was in its last throes. We have been assured again and again that we are making progress and that the Iraqis would soon stand up so we could stand down and our brave sons and daughters could start coming home. We have been asked to wait, we have been asked to be patient, and we have been asked to give the President and the new Iraqi Government 6 more months, and then 6 more months after that, and then 6 more months after that.<ul><li>Floor Statement on President's Decision to Increase Troops in Iraq (19 January 2007).</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>I have been a consistent and strong opponent of this war. I have also tried to act responsibly in that opposition to ensure that, having made the decision to go into Iraq, we provide our troops, who perform valiantly, the support they need to complete their mission. I have also stated publicly that I think we have both strategic interests and humanitarian responsibilities in ensuring that Iraq is as stable as possible under the circumstances. Finally, I said publicly that it is my preference not to micromanage the Commander-in-Chief in the prosecution of war. Ultimately, I do not believe that is the ideal role for Congress to play. But at a certain point, we have to draw a line. At a certain point, the American people have to have some confidence that we are not simply going down this blind alley in perpetuity.<br />When it comes to the war in Iraq, the time for promises and assurances, for waiting and patience is over. Too many lives have been lost and too many billions have been spent for us to trust the President on another tried-and-failed policy, opposed by generals and experts, opposed by Democrats and Republicans, opposed by Americans and even the Iraqis themselves.

This policy that I've laid out is consistent with what I have advocated for well over a year, with many of the recommendations of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, and with what the American people demanded in the November election.<br />When it comes to the war in Iraq, the time for promises and assurances, for waiting and patience, is over.

In instances of self-defense, the President would be within his constitutional authority to act before advising Congress or seeking its consent.

It is always preferable to have the informed consent of Congress prior to any military action.

It was stained by this nation's original sin of <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/slavery_in_the_United_States" class="extiw" title="w:slavery in the United States">slavery</a>, a question that divided the colonies and brought the convention to a stalemate until the founders chose to allow the slave trade to continue for at least twenty more years, and to leave any final resolution to future generations.<br />Of course, the answer to the slavery question was already embedded within our <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Constitution" class="extiw" title="w:United States Constitution">Constitution</a> - <b>a Constitution that had at its very core the ideal of equal citizenship under the law; a Constitution that promised its people liberty, and justice, and a union that could be and should be perfected over time.</b><br />And yet words on a parchment would not be enough to deliver slaves from bondage, or provide men and women of every color and creed their full rights and obligations as citizens of the United States.

That anger may not get expressed in public, in front of white co-workers or white friends. But it does find voice in the barbershop or around the kitchen table. At times, that anger is exploited by politicians, to gin up votes along racial lines, or to make up for a politician's own failings.<br />And occasionally it finds voice in the church on Sunday morning, in the pulpit and in the pews. The fact that so many people are surprised to hear that anger in some of Reverend Wright's sermons simply reminds us of the old truism that the most segregated hour in American life occurs on Sunday morning. That anger is not always productive; indeed, all too often it distracts attention from solving real problems; it keeps us from squarely facing our own complicity in our condition, and prevents the African-American community from forging the alliances it needs to bring about real change. But the anger is real; it is powerful; and to simply wish it away, to condemn it without understanding its roots, only serves to widen the chasm of misunderstanding that exists between the races.</li></ul><ul><li>The church contains in full the kindness and cruelty, the fierce intelligence and the shocking ignorance, the struggles and successes, the love and yes, the bitterness and bias that make up the black experience in America.<br />And this helps explain, perhaps, my relationship with Reverend Wright. As imperfect as he may be, he has been like family to me. He strengthened my faith, officiated my wedding, and baptized my children. Not once in my conversations with him have I heard him talk about any ethnic group in derogatory terms, or treat whites with whom he interacted with anything but courtesy and respect. He contains within him the contradictions - the good and the bad - of the community that he has served diligently for so many years.<br />I can no more disown him than I can disown the black community. I can no more disown him than I can my white grandmother - a woman who helped raise me, a woman who sacrificed again and again for me, a woman who loves me as much as she loves anything in this world, but a woman who once confessed her fear of black men who passed by her on the street, and who on more than one occasion has uttered racial or ethnic stereotypes that made me cringe.<br />These people are a part of me. And they are a part of America, this country that I love.</li></ul><ul><li>But for all those who scratched and clawed their way to get a piece of the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Dream" class="extiw" title="w:American Dream">American Dream</a>, there were many who didn't make it - those who were ultimately defeated, in one way or another, by discrimination. That legacy of defeat was passed on to future generations - those young men and increasingly young women who we see standing on street corners or languishing in our prisons, without <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/hope" class="extiw" title="w:hope">hope</a> or prospects for the future. Even for those blacks who did make it, questions of race, and racism, continue to define their <a href="/wiki/World-view" title="World-view" class="mw-redirect">world-view</a> in fundamental ways. For the men and women of Reverend Wright’s generation, the memories of <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/humiliation" class="extiw" title="w:humiliation">humiliation</a> and <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/doubt" class="extiw" title="w:doubt">doubt</a> and <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/fear" class="extiw" title="w:fear">fear</a> have not gone away; nor has the anger and the bitterness of those years.<br />That anger may not get expressed in public, in front of white co-workers or white friends. But it does find voice in the barbershop, or the beauty shop, or around the kitchen table. At times, that anger is exploited by politicians, to gin up votes along racial lines, or to make up for a politician's own failing. And occasionally it finds voice in the church on Sunday morning, in the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pulpit" class="extiw" title="w:pulpit">pulpit</a> and in the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/pew" class="extiw" title="w:pew">pews</a>. The fact that so many people are surprised to hear that anger in some of Reverend Wright's sermons simply reminds us of the old truism that <b>the most segregated hour of American life occurs on Sunday morning.</b></li></ul><ul><li>It's a racial stalemate we've been stuck in for years. And contrary to the claims of some of my critics, black and white, I have never been so naïve as to believe that we can get beyond our racial divisions in a single election cycle, or with a single candidate - particularly a candidacy as imperfect as my own.<br />But I have asserted a firm conviction - a conviction rooted in my faith in God and my faith in the American people - that <b>working together we can move beyond some of our old racial wounds, and</b> that <b>in fact we have no choice. We have no choice if we are to continue on the path of a more perfect union.</b></li></ul><ul><li>For the African-American community, that path means embracing the burdens of our past without becoming victims of our past. It means continuing to insist on a full measure of justice in every aspect of American life. But it also means binding our particular grievances - for better health care, and better schools, and better jobs - to the larger aspirations of all Americans: the white woman struggling to break the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glass_ceiling" class="extiw" title="w:Glass ceiling">glass ceiling</a>, the white man who's been laid off, the immigrant trying to feed his family. And it means also taking full responsibility for our own lives - by demanding more from our fathers, and spending more time with our children, and reading to them, and teaching them that while they may face challenges and discrimination in their own lives, they must never succumb to despair or cynicism. They must always believe that they can write their own destiny.</li></ul><ul><li>In the white community, the path to a more perfect union means acknowledging that what ails the African-American community does not just exist in the minds of black people; that the legacy of discrimination - and current incidents of discrimination, while less overt than in the past - that these things are real and must be addressed. Not just with words, but with deeds by investing in our schools and our communities; by enforcing our civil rights laws and ensuring fairness in our criminal justice system; by providing this generation with ladders of opportunity that were unavailable for previous generations. It requires all Americans to realize that your dreams do not have to come at the expense of my dreams; that investing in the health, welfare, and education of black and brown and white children will ultimately help all of America prosper.</li></ul><ul><li>This union may never be perfect, but generation after generation has shown that it can always be perfected. And today, whenever I find myself feeling doubtful or cynical about this possibility, what gives me the most hope is the next generation — the young people whose attitudes and beliefs and openness to change have already made history in this election.</li></ul><ul><li>Ashley finishes her story and then goes around the room and asks everyone else why they're supporting the campaign. They all have different stories and reasons. Many bring up a specific issue. And finally they come to this elderly black man who's been sitting there quietly the entire time. And Ashley asks him why he's there. And he does not bring up a specific issue. He does not say health care or the economy. He does not say education or the war. He does not say that he was there because of Barack Obama. He simply says to everyone in the room, "I am here because of Ashley."<br />"I'm here because of Ashley." By itself, that single moment of recognition between that young white girl and that old black man is not enough. It is not enough to give health care to the sick, or jobs to the jobless, or education to our children.<br />But it is where we start. It is where our union grows stronger. And as so many generations have come to realize over the course of the two-hundred and twenty one years since a band of patriots signed that document in Philadelphia, that is where the perfection begins.</li></ul><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="A_World_that_Stands_as_One_.28July_2008.29">A World that Stands as One (July 2008)</span></h4><dl><dd><small><a href="//en.wikisource.org/wiki/Remarks_of_Senator_Barack_Obama:_A_World_that_Stands_as_One" class="extiw" title="s:Remarks of Senator Barack Obama: A World that Stands as One">Speech delivered in Berlin, Germany</a> (24 July 2008)</small></dd></dl><div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:222px;"><a href="/wiki/File:Obama-2.jpg" class="image"><img alt="" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Obama-2.jpg/220px-Obama-2.jpg" width="220" height="147" class="thumbimage" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Obama-2.jpg/330px-Obama-2.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4b/Obama-2.jpg/440px-Obama-2.jpg 2x" data-file-width="1024" data-file-height="683" /></a><div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/wiki/File:Obama-2.jpg" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div> The scale of our challenge is great.

What has always united us - what has always driven our people; what drew my father to America's shores - is a set of ideals that speak to <b>aspirations shared by all people: that we can <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four_Freedoms" class="extiw" title="w:Four Freedoms">live free from fear and free from want</a>; that we can <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_speech" class="extiw" title="w:Freedom of speech">speak our minds</a> and <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_assembly" class="extiw" title="w:Freedom of assembly">assemble with whomever we choose</a> and <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_religion" class="extiw" title="w:Freedom of religion">worship as we please</a>.</b> These are the aspirations that joined the fates of all nations in this city. <b>These aspirations are bigger than anything that drives us apart.</b></li></ul><ul><li>People of Berlin — and people of the world — the scale of our challenge is great.

It's the answer spoken by young and old, rich and poor, Democrat and Republican, black, white, Hispanic, Asian, Native American, gay, straight, disabled and not disabled. Americans who sent a message to the world that we have never been just a collection of individuals or a collection of red states and blue states.<br />We are, and always will be, the United States of America.<br />It's the answer that led those who've been told for so long by so many to be cynical and fearful and doubtful about what we can achieve to put their hands on the arc of history and bend it once more toward the hope of a better day.<br />It's been a long time coming, but tonight, because of what we did on this date in this election at this defining moment, change has come to America.</li></ul><ul><li>I will never forget who this victory truly belongs to. It belongs to you. It belongs to you.<br />I was never the likeliest candidate for this office. We didn't start with much money or many endorsements. Our campaign was not hatched in the halls of Washington. It began in the backyards of Des Moines and the living rooms of Concord and the front porches of Charleston. It was built by working men and women who dug into what little savings they had to give $5 and $10 and $20 to the cause.<br />It grew strength from the young people who rejected the myth of their generation's apathy who left their homes and their families for jobs that offered little pay and less sleep.<br />It drew strength from the not-so-young people who braved the bitter cold and scorching heat to knock on doors of perfect strangers, and from the millions of Americans who volunteered and organized and proved that more than two centuries later a government of the people, by the people, and for the people has not perished from the Earth.<br />This is your victory.<br />And I know you didn't do this just to win an election. And I know you didn't do it for me.<br />You did it because you understand the enormity of the task that lies ahead. For even as we celebrate tonight, we know the challenges that tomorrow will bring are the greatest of our lifetime — two wars, a planet in peril, the worst financial crisis in a century.<br />Even as we stand here tonight, we know there are brave Americans waking up in the deserts of Iraq and the mountains of Afghanistan to risk their lives for us.</li></ul><ul><li>The road ahead will be long. Our climb will be steep. We may not get there in one year or even in one term. But, America, I have never been more hopeful than I am tonight that we will get there.<br />I promise you, we as a people will get there.</li></ul><ul><li>There will be setbacks and false starts. There are many who won't agree with every decision or policy I make as president. And we know the government can't solve every problem.<br />But I will always be honest with you about the challenges we face. I will listen to you, especially when we disagree.</li></ul><ul><li>This victory alone is not the change we seek. It is only the chance for us to make that change. And that cannot happen if we go back to the way things were.<br />It can't happen without you, without a new spirit of service, a new spirit of sacrifice.<br />So let us summon a new spirit of patriotism, of responsibility, where each of us resolves to pitch in and work harder and look after not only ourselves but each other.</li></ul><ul><li>In this country, we rise or fall as one nation, as one people. Let's resist the temptation to fall back on the same partisanship and pettiness and immaturity that has poisoned our politics for so long.</li></ul><ul><li>To those who would tear the world down: We will defeat you. To those who seek peace and security: We support you. And to all those who have wondered if America's beacon still burns as bright: Tonight we proved once more that the true strength of our nation comes not from the might of our arms or the scale of our wealth, but from the enduring power of our ideals: democracy, liberty, opportunity and unyielding hope.</li></ul><ul><li>This is our moment. This is our time, to put our people back to work and open doors of opportunity for our kids; to restore prosperity and promote the cause of peace; to reclaim the American Dream and reaffirm that fundamental truth, that, out of many, we are one; that while we breathe, we hope. And where we are met with cynicism and doubts and those who tell us that we can't, we will respond with that timeless creed that sums up the spirit of a people: Yes, we can.<br />Thank you. God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America.</li></ul><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="2009">2009</span></h3><ul><li>Transparency and the rule of law will be the touchstones of this presidency.<ul><li>At the signing of executive orders on first full day as president, as reported in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/01/21/obama.business/index.html">"Vowing transparency, Obama OKs ethics guidelines" at <i>CNN.com</i> (21 January 2009)</a>.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>You can't just listen to Rush Limbaugh and get things done.<ul><li>In reference to an attack on him by <a href="/wiki/Rush_Limbaugh" title="Rush Limbaugh">Rush Limbaugh</a> who declared that he hoped Barack Obama would fail as president. <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/barackobama/4331839/Barack-Obama-picks-a-fight-with-Rush-Limbaugh-as-bipartisan-spirit-crumbles.html">"Barack Obama picks a fight with Rush Limbaugh as bipartisan spirit crumbles" in <i>The Times</i> (24 January 2009)</a>.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Look, I'm at the start of my administration.

Let me be clear: I do not view it as a recognition of my own accomplishments, but rather as an affirmation of American leadership on behalf of aspirations held by people in all nations.<br />To be honest, I do not feel that I deserve to be in the company of so many of the transformative figures who've been honored by this prize — men and women who've inspired me and inspired the entire world through their courageous pursuit of peace.<br />But I also know that this prize reflects the kind of world that those men and women, and all Americans, want to build — a world that gives life to the promise of our founding documents. And I know that throughout history, the Nobel Peace Prize has not just been used to honor specific achievement; it's also been used as a means to give momentum to a set of causes. And that is why I will accept this award as a call to action — a call for all nations to confront the common challenges of the 21st century.<ul><li>Remarks by the President on winning the Nobel Peace Prize" (9 October 2009).</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Some of the work confronting us will not be completed during my presidency.

What I reject is when some folks want to go to the policies that helped get us into this mess in the first place — as if we don't remember.

The words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace. Yet, every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms. At these moments, <b>America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office, but because We the People have remained faithful to the ideals of our forbearers, and true to our founding documents. So it has been. So it must be with this generation of Americans.</b></li></ul><ul><li>Today I say to you that the challenges we face are real. They are serious and they are many.<br />They will not be met easily or in a short span of time. But know this, America — they will be met. On this day, we gather because we have chosen hope over fear, unity of purpose over conflict and discord.<br />On this day, we come to proclaim an end to the petty grievances and false promises, the recriminations and worn out dogmas, that for far too long have strangled our politics.</li></ul><ul><li><b>We remain a young nation, but in the words of <a href="/wiki/The_Bible" title="The Bible">Scripture</a>, <a href="/wiki/Bible#1_Corinthians_13" title="Bible" class="mw-redirect">the time has come to set aside childish things</a>. The time has come to reaffirm our enduring spirit; to choose our better history; to carry forward that precious gift, that noble idea, passed on from generation to generation: <a href="/wiki/United_States_Declaration_of_Independence" title="United States Declaration of Independence">the God-given promise that all are equal, all are free, and all deserve a chance to pursue their full measure of happiness.</a></b>.</li></ul><ul><li>In reaffirming the greatness of our nation, we understand that <b>greatness is never a given. It must be earned. Our journey has never been one of short-cuts or settling for less. It has not been the path for the faint-hearted — for those who prefer leisure over work, or seek only the pleasures of riches and fame. Rather, it has been the risk-takers, the doers, the makers of things — some celebrated but more often men and women obscure in their labor, who have carried us up the long, rugged path towards prosperity and <a href="/wiki/Freedom" title="Freedom">freedom</a>.</b> [...] Time and again these men and women struggled and sacrificed and worked till their hands were raw so that we might live a better life. They saw America as bigger than the sum of our individual ambitions; greater than all the differences of birth or wealth or faction.</li></ul><ul><li>We remain the most prosperous, powerful nation on Earth. Our minds are no less inventive, our goods and services no less needed than they were last week or last month or last year. Our capacity remains undiminished. But our time of standing pat, of protecting narrow interests and putting off unpleasant decisions — that time has surely passed. <b>Starting today, we must pick ourselves up, dust ourselves off, and begin again the work of remaking America.</b></li></ul><ul><li>For everywhere we look, there is work to be done. The state of the economy calls for action, bold and swift, and we will act — not only to create new jobs, but to lay a new foundation for growth. We will build the roads and bridges, the electric grids and digital lines that feed our commerce and bind us together. We will restore science to its rightful place, and wield technology's wonders to raise health care's quality and lower its cost. We will harness the sun and the winds and the soil to fuel our cars and run our factories. And we will transform our schools and colleges and universities to meet the demands of a new age. All this we can do. And all this we will do.</li></ul><ul><li>Now, there are some who question the scale of our ambitions — who suggest that our system cannot tolerate too many big plans. Their memories are short. For they have forgotten what this country has already done; what free men and women can achieve when imagination is joined to common purpose, and necessity to courage.</li></ul><ul><li>What the cynics fail to understand is that the ground has shifted beneath them — that the stale political arguments that have consumed us for so long no longer apply. <b>The question we ask today is not whether our government is too <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_government" class="extiw" title="w:Big government">big</a> or too <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small_government" class="extiw" title="w:Small government">small</a>, but whether it works — whether it helps families find jobs at a decent wage, care they can afford, a retirement that is dignified.</b> Where the answer is yes, we intend to move forward. Where the answer is no, programs will end.</li></ul><ul><li>Nor is the question before us whether <b>the market is a force for good</b> or ill. <b>Its power to generate wealth and expand freedom is unmatched, but</b> <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Recession" class="extiw" title="w:Great Recession">this crisis</a> has reminded us that <b>without a watchful eye, the market can spin out of control — and</b> that <b>a nation cannot prosper long when it favors only the prosperous. The success of our economy has always depended not just on the size of our <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gross_Domestic_Product" class="extiw" title="w:Gross Domestic Product">Gross Domestic Product</a>, but on <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Income_inequality_in_the_United_States" class="extiw" title="w:Income inequality in the United States">the reach of our prosperity</a>; on our ability to extend opportunity to every willing heart — not out of charity, but because it is the surest route to our common good.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>As for our common defense, we reject as false the choice between our safety and our ideals.

Those ideals still light the world, and we will not give them up for expedience's sake. And so to all other peoples and governments who are watching today, from the grandest capitals to the small village where my father was born: know that America is a friend of each nation and every man, woman, and child who seeks a future of peace and dignity, and that we are ready to lead once more.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>Recall that earlier generations faced down <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facism" class="extiw" title="w:Facism">fascism</a> and <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Communism" class="extiw" title="w:Communism">communism</a> not just with missiles and tanks, but with sturdy alliances and enduring convictions.</b> They understood that <b>our power alone cannot protect us, nor does it entitle us to do as we please.</b> Instead, they knew that <b>our power grows through its prudent use; our security emanates from the justness of our cause, the force of our example, the tempering qualities of humility and restraint.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>We will not apologize for our way of life, nor will we waver in its defense, and for those who seek to advance their aims by inducing terror and slaughtering innocents, we say to you now that our spirit is stronger and cannot be broken; you cannot outlast us, and we will defeat you.<br />For we know that our patchwork heritage is a strength, not a weakness.

We are shaped by every language and culture, drawn from every end of this Earth; and because we have tasted the bitter swill of civil war and segregation, and emerged from that dark chapter stronger and more united, we cannot help but believe that the old hatreds shall someday pass; that the lines of tribe shall soon dissolve; that as the world grows smaller, our common humanity shall reveal itself; and that America must play its role in ushering in a new era of <a href="/wiki/Peace" title="Peace">peace</a>.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>To those leaders around the globe who seek to sow conflict, or blame their society's ills on the West — know that your people will judge you on what you can build, not what you destroy. To those who cling to power through corruption and deceit and the silencing of dissent, know that you are on the wrong side of history; but that we will extend a hand if you are willing to unclench your fist.</b></li></ul><ul><li>We can no longer afford indifference to suffering outside our borders; nor can we consume the world's resources without regard to effect. For <b>the world has changed, and we must change with it.</b></li></ul><ul><li>As we consider the road that unfolds before us, we remember with humble gratitude those brave <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War" class="extiw" title="w:Iraq War">Americans who, at this very hour, patrol far-off deserts</a> and <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_in_Afghanistan_(2001%E2%80%93present)" class="extiw" title="w:War in Afghanistan (2001–present)">distant mountains</a>.

That is not how moral authority is claimed; that is how it is surrendered.</b></li></ul><ul><li>I know there has been controversy about the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_democracy_promotion_in_the_Middle_East_and_North_Africa" class="extiw" title="w:American democracy promotion in the Middle East and North Africa">promotion of democracy in recent years</a>, and much of this controversy is connected to the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_war" class="extiw" title="w:Iraq war">war in Iraq</a>. So let me be clear: <b>no system of government can or should be imposed upon one nation by any other.</b><br />That does not lessen my commitment, however, to governments that reflect the will of the people. Each nation gives life to this principle in its own way, grounded in the traditions of its own people. America does not presume to know what is best for everyone, just as we would not presume to pick the outcome of a peaceful election. But I do have an unyielding belief that <b>all people yearn for certain things: the ability to speak your mind and have a say in how you are governed; confidence in the rule of law and the equal administration of justice; government that is transparent and doesn't steal from the people; the freedom to live as you choose. Those are not just American ideas, they are human rights</b>, and that is why we will support them everywhere.<br />Now, there is no straight line to realise this promise. But this much is clear: <b>governments that protect these rights are ultimately more stable, successful and secure.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>Suppressing ideas never succeeds in making them go away.</b> America respects the right of all peaceful and law-abiding voices to be heard around the world, even if we disagree with them. And we will welcome all elected, peaceful governments - provided they govern with respect for all their people.<br />This last point is important because there are some who advocate for democracy only when they are out of power; once in power, they are ruthless in suppressing the rights of others. No matter where it takes hold, <a href="/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln#The_Gettysburg_Address_.281863.29" title="Abraham Lincoln">government of the people and by the people</a> sets a single standard for all who hold power: <b>you must maintain your power through consent, not coercion; you must respect the rights of minorities, and participate with a spirit of tolerance and compromise; you must place the interests of your people and the legitimate workings of the political process above your party. Without these ingredients, elections alone do not make true <a href="/wiki/Democracy" title="Democracy">democracy</a>.</b></li></ul><ul><li>Islam has a proud tradition of tolerance.</li></ul><ul><li><b>People in every country should be free to choose and live their faith based upon the persuasion of the mind, and the heart, and the soul.

The internet and television can bring knowledge and information, but also offensive sexuality and mindless violence into the home. Trade can bring new wealth and opportunities, but also huge disruptions and change to communities. In all nations - including America - this change can bring fear. Fear that because of modernity we will lose of control over our economic choices, our politics, and most importantly our identities - those things we most cherish about our communities, our families, our traditions, and our faith. But I also know that human progress cannot be denied.

I noticed that young people — they're very busy with all these electronics. My thumbs are too clumsy to type in things on the phone. But I am a big believer in technology and I'm a big believer in openness when it comes to the flow of information. I think that the more freely information flows, the stronger the society becomes, because then citizens of countries around the world can hold their own governments accountable. They can begin to think for themselves. That generates new ideas. It encourages creativity. And so I've always been a strong supporter of open Internet use. I'm a big supporter of non-censorship.<ul><li>Interview in Shanghai, as quoted in [<a rel="nofollow" class="external free" href="http://learning.sohu.com/20091118/n268291186.shtml">http://learning.sohu.com/20091118/n268291186.shtml</a> <i>China Daily</i> (17 November 2009).</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>I can tell you that in the United States, the fact that we have free Internet — or unrestricted Internet access is a source of strength, and I think should be encouraged. Now, I should tell you, I should be honest, as President of the United States, there are times where I wish information didn't flow so freely because then I wouldn't have to listen to people criticizing me all the time. I think people naturally are — when they're in positions of power sometimes thinks, oh, how could that person say that about me, or that's irresponsible, or — but the truth is that because in the United States information is free, and I have a lot of critics in the United States who can say all kinds of things about me, I actually think that that makes our democracy stronger and it makes me a better leader because it forces me to hear opinions that I don't want to hear. It forces me to examine what I'm doing on a day-to-day basis to see, am I really doing the very best that I could be doing for the people of the United States. And I think the Internet has become an even more powerful tool for that kind of citizen participation.<ul><li>Interview in Shanghai, as quoted in <i>China Daily</i> (17 November 2009).</li></ul></li></ul><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Nobel_Prize_acceptance_speech_.28December_2009.29">Nobel Prize acceptance speech (December 2009)</span></h4><div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:222px;"><a href="/wiki/File:Gandhi_smiling_1942.jpg" class="image"><img alt="" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Gandhi_smiling_1942.jpg/220px-Gandhi_smiling_1942.jpg" width="220" height="303" class="thumbimage" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Gandhi_smiling_1942.jpg/330px-Gandhi_smiling_1942.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/61/Gandhi_smiling_1942.jpg/440px-Gandhi_smiling_1942.jpg 2x" data-file-width="557" data-file-height="768" /></a><div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/wiki/File:Gandhi_smiling_1942.jpg" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div>I am living testimony to the moral force of non-violence.

It is an award that speaks to our highest aspirations — that for all the cruelty and hardship of our world, we are not mere prisoners of fate. Our actions matter, and can bend history in the direction of justice.</b><br />And yet I would be remiss if I did not acknowledge the considerable controversy that your generous decision has generated. In part, this is because I am at the beginning, and not the end, of my labors on the world stage. Compared to some of the giants of history who've received this prize — <a href="/wiki/Albert_Schweitzer" title="Albert Schweitzer">Schweitzer</a> and <a href="/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr." title="Martin Luther King, Jr.">King</a>; <a href="/wiki/George_Marshall" title="George Marshall">Marshall</a> and <a href="/wiki/Nelson_Mandela" title="Nelson Mandela">Mandela</a> — my accomplishments are slight. And then there are the men and women around the world who have been jailed and beaten in the pursuit of justice; those who toil in humanitarian organizations to relieve suffering; the unrecognized millions whose quiet acts of courage and compassion inspire even the most hardened cynics. I cannot argue with those who find these men and women — some known, some obscure to all but those they help — to be far more deserving of this honor than I.<br />But perhaps the most profound issue surrounding my receipt of this prize is the fact that I am the Commander-in-Chief of the military of a nation in the midst of two wars. One of these wars is winding down. The other is a conflict that America did not seek; one in which we are joined by 42 other countries — including Norway — in an effort to defend ourselves and all nations from further attacks.<br />Still, we are at war, and I'm responsible for the deployment of thousands of young Americans to battle in a distant land. Some will kill, and some will be killed. And so I come here with an acute sense of the costs of armed conflict — filled with difficult questions about the relationship between war and peace, and our effort to replace one with the other.</li></ul><ul><li>Terrorism has long been a tactic, but modern technology allows a few small men with outsized rage to murder innocents on a horrific scale.</li></ul><ul><li>In today's wars, many more civilians are killed than soldiers; the seeds of future conflict are sown, economies are wrecked, civil societies torn asunder, refugees amassed, children scarred.<br />I do not bring with me today a definitive solution to the problems of war. What I do know is that meeting these challenges will require the same vision, hard work, and persistence of those men and women who acted so boldly decades ago. And it will require us to think in new ways about the notions of just war and the imperatives of a just peace.<br /><b>We must begin by acknowledging the hard truth: We will not eradicate violent conflict in our lifetimes. There will be times when nations — acting individually or in concert — will find the use of force not only necessary but morally justified.</b><br />I make this statement mindful of what Martin Luther King Jr. said in this same ceremony years ago: "Violence never brings permanent peace. It solves no social problem: it merely creates new and more complicated ones." <b>As someone who stands here as a direct consequence of Dr. King's life work, I am living testimony to the moral force of non-violence. I know there's nothing weak — nothing passive — nothing naïve — in the creed and lives of <a href="/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi" title="Mahatma Gandhi">Gandhi</a> and King.</b><br />But as a head of state sworn to protect and defend my nation, I cannot be guided by their examples alone. I face the world as it is, and cannot stand idle in the face of threats to the American people. For make no mistake: <b>Evil does exist in the world. A non-violent movement could not have halted <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" title="Adolf Hitler">Hitler</a>'s armies. <a href="/wiki/Negotiations" title="Negotiations">Negotiations</a> cannot convince al Qaeda's leaders to lay down their arms. To say that force may sometimes be necessary is not a call to cynicism — it is a recognition of history; the imperfections of man and the limits of reason.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>The world must remember that it was not simply international institutions — not just treaties and declarations — that brought stability to a post-World War II world. Whatever mistakes we have made, the plain fact is this: The United States of America has helped underwrite global security for more than six decades with the blood of our citizens and the strength of our arms.</b> The service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform has promoted peace and prosperity from Germany to Korea, and enabled democracy to take hold in places like the Balkans. We have borne this burden not because we seek to impose our will. We have done so out of enlightened self-interest — because we seek a better future for our children and grandchildren, and we believe that their lives will be better if others' children and grandchildren can live in freedom and prosperity.<br />So yes, the instruments of war do have a role to play in preserving the peace. And yet this truth must coexist with another — that no matter how justified, war promises human tragedy. The soldier's courage and sacrifice is full of glory, expressing devotion to country, to cause, to comrades in arms. <b>But war itself is never glorious, and we must never trumpet it as such.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>I believe that all nations — strong and weak alike — must adhere to standards that govern the use of force.</b> I — like any head of state — reserve the right to act unilaterally if necessary to defend my nation. Nevertheless, I am convinced that adhering to standards, international standards, strengthens those who do, and isolates and weakens those who don't.</li><li>More and more, we all confront difficult questions about how to prevent the slaughter of civilians by their own government, or to stop a civil war whose violence and suffering can engulf an entire region.<br />I believe that force can be justified on humanitarian grounds, as it was in the Balkans, or in other places that have been scarred by war. Inaction tears at our conscience and can lead to more costly intervention later. That's why all responsible nations must embrace the role that militaries with a clear mandate can play to keep the peace.</li></ul><ul><li><b>I understand why war is not popular, but I also know this: The belief that peace is desirable is rarely enough to achieve it. Peace requires responsibility. Peace entails sacrifice.</b> That's why NATO continues to be indispensable. That's why we must strengthen U.N. and regional peacekeeping, and not leave the task to a few countries.</li><li>Let me make one final point about the use of force. <b>Even as we make difficult decisions about going to war, we must also think clearly about how we fight it.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>Where force is necessary, we have a moral and strategic interest in binding ourselves to certain rules of conduct.</b> And even as we confront a vicious adversary that abides by no rules, I believe the United States of America must remain a standard bearer in the conduct of war. That is what makes us different from those whom we fight. That is a source of our strength. That is why I prohibited torture. That is why I ordered the prison at Guantanamo Bay closed. And that is why I have reaffirmed America's commitment to abide by the Geneva Conventions. We lose ourselves when we compromise the very ideals that we fight to defend. And we honor — we honor those ideals by upholding them not when it's easy, but when it is hard.</li></ul><ul><li>I believe that we must develop alternatives to violence that are tough enough to actually change behavior — for if we want a lasting peace, then the words of the international community must mean something. Those regimes that break the rules must be held accountable. <b>Sanctions must exact a real price. Intransigence must be met with increased pressure — and such pressure exists only when the world stands together as one.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>Peace is not merely the absence of visible conflict. Only a just peace based on the inherent rights and dignity of every individual can truly be lasting.</b><br />It was this insight that drove drafters of the <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights" class="extiw" title="w:Universal Declaration of Human Rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a> after the Second World War. In the wake of devastation, they recognized that if human rights are not protected, peace is a hollow promise.</li></ul><ul><li><b>There has long been a tension between those who describe themselves as realists or idealists — a tension that suggests a stark choice between the narrow pursuit of interests or an endless campaign to impose our values around the world.<br />I reject these choices.</b> I believe that peace is unstable where citizens are denied the right to speak freely or worship as they please; choose their own leaders or assemble without fear. Pent-up grievances fester, and the suppression of tribal and religious identity can lead to violence. We also know that the opposite is true. Only when Europe became free did it finally find peace. <b>America has never fought a war against a democracy, and our closest friends are governments that protect the rights of their citizens. No matter how callously defined, neither America's interests — nor the world's — are served by the denial of human aspirations.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>There's no simple formula here. But we must try as best we can to balance isolation and engagement, pressure and incentives, so that human rights and dignity are advanced over time.</b></li></ul><ul><li>A just peace includes not only civil and political rights — it must encompass economic security and opportunity. For true peace is not just freedom from fear, but freedom from want.<br />It is undoubtedly true that development rarely takes root without security; it is also true that security does not exist where human beings do not have access to enough food, or clean water, or the medicine and shelter they need to survive. It does not exist where children can't aspire to a decent education or a job that supports a family. <b>The absence of hope can rot a society from within.</b></li></ul><ul><li>Agreements among nations. Strong institutions. Support for human rights. Investments in development. All these are vital ingredients in bringing about the evolution that President <a href="/wiki/John_F._Kennedy" title="John F. Kennedy">Kennedy</a> spoke about. And yet, I do not believe that we will have the will, the determination, the staying power, to complete this work without something more — and that's the continued expansion of our moral imagination; an insistence that there's something irreducible that we all share.</li></ul><ul><li><b>As the world grows smaller, you might think it would be easier for human beings to recognize how similar we are; to understand that we're all basically seeking the same things; that we all hope for the chance to live out our lives with some measure of happiness and fulfillment for ourselves and our families.</b><br />And yet somehow, given the dizzying pace of globalization, the cultural leveling of modernity, it perhaps comes as no surprise that people fear the loss of what they cherish in their particular identities — their race, their tribe, and perhaps most powerfully their religion. In some places, this fear has led to conflict. At times, it even feels like we're moving backwards.</li></ul><ul><li><b>The one rule that lies at the heart of every major religion is that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us.<br />Adhering to this law of love has always been the core struggle of human nature.</b> For we are fallible. We make mistakes, and fall victim to the temptations of pride, and power, and sometimes evil. Even those of us with the best of intentions will at times fail to right the wrongs before us.</li></ul><ul><li><b>We do not have to think that human nature is perfect for us to still believe that the human condition can be perfected. We do not have to live in an idealized world to still reach for those ideals that will make it a better place.</b> The non-violence practiced by men like Gandhi and King may not have been practical or possible in every circumstance, but the love that they preached — their fundamental faith in human progress — that must always be the North Star that guides us on our journey.<br /><b>For if we lose that faith — if we dismiss it as silly or naïve; if we divorce it from the decisions that we make on issues of war and peace — then we lose what's best about humanity. We lose our sense of possibility. We lose our moral compass.</b><br />Like generations have before us, we must reject that future. As Dr. King said at this occasion so many years ago, "I refuse to accept despair as the final response to the ambiguities of history. I refuse to accept the idea that the 'isness' of man's present condition makes him morally incapable of reaching up for the eternal 'oughtness' that forever confronts him."<br /><b>Let us reach for the world that ought to be — that spark of the divine that still stirs within each of our souls.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>We can acknowledge that oppression will always be with us, and still strive for justice.</b> We can admit the intractability of deprivation, and still strive for dignity. <b>Clear-eyed, we can understand that there will be war, and still strive for peace. We can do that — for that is the story of human progress; that's the hope of all the world; and at this moment of challenge, that must be our work here on Earth.</b></li></ul><h3><span class="mw-headline" id="2010">2010</span></h3><div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:222px;"><a href="/wiki/File:BarackObama2010_3.jpg" class="image"><img alt="" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/BarackObama2010_3.jpg/220px-BarackObama2010_3.jpg" width="220" height="146" class="thumbimage" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/BarackObama2010_3.jpg/330px-BarackObama2010_3.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/24/BarackObama2010_3.jpg/440px-BarackObama2010_3.jpg 2x" data-file-width="4288" data-file-height="2848" /></a><div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/wiki/File:BarackObama2010_3.jpg" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div>Prosperity without freedom is just another form of poverty.</div></div></div><ul><li>Guantanamo will be closed no later than one year from now.<ul><li><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/barackobama/4316784/Barack-Obama-signs-order-to-close-Guantnamo-Bay-prison-camp.html">"Barack Obama signs order to close Guantánamo Bay prison camp", <i>The Telegraph</i> (22 January 2009)</a>.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>We said from the start that it was going to be important for us to be consistent in saying to people if you can have your — if you want to keep the health insurance you got, you can keep it, that you're not going to have anybody getting in between you and your doctor in your decision making.

And my mother was one of the most spiritual people I knew, but she didn't raise me in the church. So I came to my Christian faith later in life, and it was because the precepts of <a href="/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a> <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christ" class="extiw" title="w:Christ">Christ</a> spoke to me in terms of the kind of life that I would want to lead — being my brothers' and sisters' keeper, treating others as they would treat me. I think also understanding that Jesus Christ dying for my sins spoke to the humility we all have to have as human beings, that we're sinful and we're flawed and we make mistakes, and that we achieve salvation through the grace of God. <b>But what we can do, as flawed as we are, is still see God in other people and do our best to help them find their own grace. That's what I strive to do. That's what I pray to do every day.</b> I think my public service is part of that effort to express my Christian faith. …&#160;One thing I want to emphasize, having spoken about something that obviously relates to me very personally, as president of the United States <b>I'm also somebody who deeply believes that part of the bedrock strength of this country is that it embraces people of many faiths and no faith… that this is a country that is still predominantly Christian, but we have Jews, Muslims, Hindus, atheists, agnostics, Buddhists, and that their own path to grace is one that we have to revere and respect as much as our own.<br />That's part of what makes this country what it is.</b><ul><li>Statement during National Prayer Breakfast (27 September 2010), <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/09/28/obama-christian-by-choice_n_742124.html?view=print">"Obama 'Christian By Choice': President Responds To Questioner" by Charles Babington and Darlene Superville, <i>Associated Press</i> (28 September 2010)</a> - <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://blogs.abcnews.com/politicalpunch/2010/09/president-obama-i-am-a-christian-by-choicethe-precepts-of-jesus-spoke-to-me.html">Video&#160;: President Obama: "I am a Christian By Choice" at <i>ABC News</i> (29 September 2010)</a>.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li><b>Prosperity without freedom is just another form of poverty.

That is why yesterday, we called for an evacuation of American citizens who are within 50 miles of the plant. This decision was based upon a careful scientific evaluation and the guidelines that we would use to keep our citizens safe here in the United States, or anywhere in the world.</li></ul><ul><li>I know that many Americans are also worried about the potential risks to the United States. So I want to be very clear: We do not expect harmful levels of radiation to reach the United States, whether it’s the West Coast, Hawaii, Alaska, or U.S. territories in the Pacific. Let me repeat that: We do not expect harmful levels of radiation to reach the West Coast, Hawaii, Alaska, or U.S. territories in the Pacific. <b>That is the judgment of our Nuclear Regulatory Commission and many other experts.</b></li></ul><ul><li>Our nuclear power plants have undergone exhaustive study, and have been declared safe for any number of extreme contingencies. But when we see a crisis like the one in Japan, we have a responsibility to learn from this event, and to draw from those lessons to ensure the safety and security of our people.<br />That’s why I’ve asked the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to do a comprehensive review of the safety of our domestic nuclear plants in light of the natural disaster that unfolded in Japan.</li></ul><ul><li><b>We are working aggressively to support our Japanese ally at this time of extraordinary challenge.</b> Search and rescue teams are on the ground in Japan to help the recovery effort. A disaster assistance and response team is working to confront the aftermath of the earthquake and tsunami. The U.S. military, which has helped to ensure the security of Japan for decades, is working around the clock.</li></ul><ul><li>We have an alliance that was forged more than a half century ago, and strengthened by shared interests and democratic values. Our people share ties of family, ties of culture, and ties of commerce. Our troops have served to protect Japan’s shores, and our citizens have found opportunity and friendship in Japan’s cities and towns.</li></ul><ul><li>I am confident that Japan will recover and rebuild because of the strength and spirit of the Japanese people. Over the last few days, they’ve opened up their homes to one another. They’ve shared scarce resources of food and water. They’ve organized shelters, provided free medical care, and looked out for their most vulnerable citizens. One man put it simply: “It’s a Japanese thing. When hard times hit, we have to help each other.”</li></ul><ul><li><b>In the midst of economic recovery and global upheaval, disasters like this remind us of the common humanity that we share.</b> We see it in the responders who are risking their lives at Fukushima. We show it through the help that has poured into Japan from 70 countries. And we hear it in the cries of a child, miraculously pulled from the rubble.<br /><b>In the coming days, we will continue to do everything we can to ensure the safety of American citizens and the security of our sources of energy.

They have moved with incredible speed and strength. Because of them and our dedicated diplomats, a coalition has been forged and countless lives have been saved.<br />Meanwhile, as we speak, our troops are supporting our ally Japan, leaving Iraq to its people, stopping the Taliban’s momentum in Afghanistan, and going after al Qaeda all across the globe. As Commander-in-Chief, I’m grateful to our soldiers, sailors, airmen, Marines, Coast Guardsmen, and to their families. And I know all Americans share in that sentiment.</li></ul><ul><li><b>For generations, the United States of America has played a unique role as an anchor of global security and as an advocate for human freedom. Mindful of the risks and costs of military action, we are naturally reluctant to use force to solve the world’s many challenges. But when our interests and values are at stake, we have a responsibility to act.</b> That’s what happened in Libya over the course of these last six weeks.&#160;</li></ul><ul><li><b>If we waited one more day, Benghazi, a city nearly the size of Charlotte, could suffer a massacre that would have reverberated across the region and stained the conscience of the world.<br />It was not in our national interest to let that happen. I refused to let that happen.</b> And so nine days ago, after consulting the bipartisan leadership of Congress, I authorized military action to stop the killing and enforce U.N. Security Council Resolution 1973.&#160;</li></ul><ul><li><b>In just one month, the United States has worked with our international partners to mobilize a broad coalition, secure an international mandate to protect civilians, stop an advancing army, prevent a massacre, and establish a no-fly zone with our allies and partners.</b> To lend some perspective on how rapidly this military and diplomatic response came together, when people were being brutalized in Bosnia in the 1990s, it took the international community more than a year to intervene with air power to protect civilians. It took us 31 days.</li></ul><ul><li>I want to be clear: The United States of America has done what we said we would do.<br />That’s not to say that our work is complete.</li></ul><ul><li><b>While our military mission is narrowly focused on saving lives, we continue to pursue the broader goal of a Libya that belongs not to a dictator, but to its people.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>Much of the debate in Washington has put forward a false choice when it comes to Libya.</b> On the one hand, some question why America should intervene at all — even in limited ways — in this distant land. They argue that there are many places in the world where innocent civilians face brutal violence at the hands of their government, and America should not be expected to police the world, particularly when we have so many pressing needs here at home.<br /><b>It’s true that America cannot use our military wherever repression occurs. And given the costs and risks of intervention, we must always measure our interests against the need for action.&#160;But that cannot be an argument for never acting on behalf of what’s right.</b> In this particular country — Libya — at this particular moment, we were faced with the prospect of violence on a horrific scale. <b>We had a unique ability to stop that violence: an international mandate for action, a broad coalition prepared to join us, the support of Arab countries, and a plea for help from the Libyan people themselves.</b> We also had the ability to stop Qaddafi’s forces in their tracks without putting American troops on the ground.<br /><b>To brush aside America’s responsibility as a leader and — more profoundly — our responsibilities to our fellow human beings under such circumstances would have been a betrayal of who we are.</b> Some nations may be able to turn a blind eye to atrocities in other countries. The United States of America is different. And as President, I refused to wait for the images of slaughter and mass graves before taking action.</li></ul><ul><li><b>America has an important strategic interest in preventing Qaddafi from overrunning those who oppose him.</b> A massacre would have driven thousands of additional refugees across Libya’s borders, putting enormous strains on the peaceful — yet fragile — transitions in Egypt and Tunisia. The democratic impulses that are dawning across the region would be eclipsed by the darkest form of dictatorship, as repressive leaders concluded that violence is the best strategy to cling to power. The writ of the United Nations Security Council would have been shown to be little more than empty words, crippling that institution’s future credibility to uphold global peace and security. <b>So while I will never minimize the costs involved in military action, I am convinced that a failure to act in Libya would have carried a far greater price for America.</b></li></ul><ul><li>There is no question that Libya — and the world — would be better off with Qaddafi out of power. I, along with many other world leaders, have embraced that goal, and will actively pursue it through non-military means. But broadening our military mission to include regime change would be a mistake.<br /><b>The task that I assigned our forces — to protect the Libyan people from immediate danger, and to establish a no-fly zone — carries with it a U.N. mandate and international support. It’s also what the Libyan opposition asked us to do. If we tried to overthrow Qaddafi by force, our coalition would splinter.</b> We would likely have to put U.S. troops on the ground to accomplish that mission, or risk killing many civilians from the air. The dangers faced by our men and women in uniform would be far greater. So would the costs and our share of the responsibility for what comes next.</li></ul><ul><li><b>To be blunt, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iraq_War" class="extiw" title="w:Iraq War">we went down that road in Iraq</a>.</b> Thanks to the extraordinary sacrifices of our troops and the determination of our diplomats, we are hopeful about Iraq’s future. But regime change there took eight years, thousands of American and Iraqi lives, and nearly a trillion dollars. That is not something we can afford to repeat in Libya.</li></ul><ul><li><b>As the bulk of our military effort ratchets down, what we can do — and will do — is support the aspirations of the Libyan people. We have intervened to stop a massacre, and we will work with our allies and partners to maintain the safety of civilians.</b> We will deny the regime arms, cut off its supplies of cash, assist the opposition, and work with other nations to hasten the day when Qaddafi leaves power. It may not happen overnight, as a badly weakened Qaddafi tries desperately to hang on to power. But it should be clear to those around Qaddafi, and to every Libyan, that history is not on Qaddafi’s side. With the time and space that we have provided for the Libyan people, they will be able to determine their own destiny, and that is how it should be.</li></ul><ul><li><b>As Commander-in-Chief, I have no greater responsibility than keeping this country safe. And no decision weighs on me more than when to deploy our men and women in uniform. I’ve made it clear that I will never hesitate to use our military swiftly, decisively, and unilaterally when necessary to defend our people, our homeland, our allies and our core interests.</b> That's why we’re going after al Qaeda wherever they seek a foothold. That is why we continue to fight in Afghanistan, even as we have ended our combat mission in Iraq and removed more than 100,000 troops from that country.&#160;<br /><b>There will be times, though, when our safety is not directly threatened, but our interests and our values are.</b> Sometimes, the course of history poses <b>challenges that threaten our common humanity and our common security — responding to natural disasters, for example; or preventing genocide and keeping the peace; ensuring regional security, and maintaining the flow of commerce. These may not be America’s problems alone, but they are important to us. They’re problems worth solving.</b> And in these circumstances, we know that the United States, as the world’s most powerful nation, will often be called upon to help.<br /><b>In such cases, we should not be afraid to act — but the burden of action should not be America’s alone. As we have in Libya, our task is instead to mobilize the international community for collective action.</b> Because contrary to the claims of some, American leadership is not simply a matter of going it alone and bearing all of the burden ourselves. <b>Real leadership creates the conditions and coalitions for others to step up as well; to work with allies and partners so that they bear their share of the burden and pay their share of the costs; and to see that the principles of justice and human dignity are upheld by all.</b></li></ul><ul><li>When one of our airmen parachuted to the ground, in a country whose leader has so often demonized the United States — in a region that has such a difficult history with our country — this American did not find enemies. Instead, he was met by people who embraced him. One young Libyan who came to his aid said, “We are your friends. We are so grateful to those men who are protecting the skies.”<br /><b>This voice is just one of many in a region where a new generation is refusing to be denied their rights and opportunities any longer.&#160;<br />Yes, this change will make the world more complicated for a time. Progress will be uneven, and change will come differently to different countries.</b> There are places, like Egypt, where this change will inspire us and raise our hopes. And then there will be places, like Iran, where change is fiercely suppressed. <b>The dark forces of civil conflict and sectarian war will have to be averted, and difficult political and economic concerns will have to be addressed.&#160;<br />The United States will not be able to dictate the pace and scope of this change. Only the people of the region can do that. But we can make a difference.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>I believe that this movement of change cannot be turned back, and that we must stand alongside those who believe in the same core principles that have guided us through many storms: our opposition to violence directed at one’s own people; our support for a set of universal rights, including the freedom for people to express themselves and choose their leaders; our support for governments that are ultimately responsive to the aspirations of the people.<br />Born, as we are, out of a revolution by those who longed to be free, we welcome the fact that history is on the move in the Middle East and North Africa, and that young people are leading the way.</b> Because wherever people long to be free, they will find a friend in the United States. <b>Ultimately, it is that faith — those ideals — that are the true measure of American leadership.</b></li></ul><ul><li>My fellow Americans, I know that at a time of upheaval overseas -- when the news is filled with conflict and change -- it can be tempting to turn away from the world. And as I’ve said before, <b>our strength abroad is anchored in our strength here at home. That must always be our North Star -- the ability of our people to reach their potential, to make wise choices with our resources, to enlarge the prosperity that serves as a wellspring for our power, and to live the values that we hold so dear.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>For generations, we have done the hard work of protecting our own people, as well as millions around the globe. We have done so because we know that our own future is safer, our own future is brighter, if more of mankind can live with the bright light of freedom and dignity.</b>&#160;<br />Tonight, let us give thanks for the Americans who are serving through these trying times, and the coalition that is carrying our effort forward. And <b>let us look to the future with confidence and hope not only for our own country, but for all those yearning for freedom around the world.</b></li></ul><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Remarks_on_death_of_Osama_bin_Laden_.28May_2011.29">Remarks on death of Osama bin Laden (May 2011)</span></h4><div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:222px;"><a href="/wiki/File:National_Park_Service_9-11_Statue_of_Liberty_and_WTC_fire.jpg" class="image"><img alt="" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/National_Park_Service_9-11_Statue_of_Liberty_and_WTC_fire.jpg/220px-National_Park_Service_9-11_Statue_of_Liberty_and_WTC_fire.jpg" width="220" height="167" class="thumbimage" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/National_Park_Service_9-11_Statue_of_Liberty_and_WTC_fire.jpg/330px-National_Park_Service_9-11_Statue_of_Liberty_and_WTC_fire.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/fd/National_Park_Service_9-11_Statue_of_Liberty_and_WTC_fire.jpg 2x" data-file-width="350" data-file-height="265" /></a><div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/wiki/File:National_Park_Service_9-11_Statue_of_Liberty_and_WTC_fire.jpg" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div>On <a href="/wiki/September_11_attacks" title="September 11 attacks">September 11, 2001</a>, in our time of grief, the American people came together.

Tonight, I can report to the American people and to the world that the United States has conducted an operation that killed <a href="/wiki/Osama_bin_Laden" title="Osama bin Laden">Osama bin Laden</a>, the leader of al Qaeda, and a terrorist who’s responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent men, women, and children.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>On <a href="/wiki/September_11_attacks" title="September 11 attacks">September 11, 2001</a>, in our time of grief, the American people came together. We offered our neighbors a hand, and we offered the wounded our blood. We reaffirmed our ties to each other, and our love of community and country.</b> On that day, no matter where we came from, what God we prayed to, or what race or ethnicity we were, we were united as one American family.<br />We were also united in our resolve to protect our nation and to bring those who committed this vicious attack to justice. We quickly learned that the 9/11 attacks were carried out by al Qaeda — an organization headed by Osama bin Laden, which had openly declared war on the United States and was committed to killing innocents in our country and around the globe. <b>And so we went to war against al Qaeda to protect our citizens, our friends, and our allies.</b></li></ul><ul><li>Last August, after years of painstaking work by our intelligence community, I was briefed on a possible lead to bin Laden. It was far from certain, and it took many months to run this thread to ground. I met repeatedly with my national security team as we developed more information about the possibility that we had located bin Laden hiding within a compound deep inside of Pakistan. And finally, last week, I determined that we had enough intelligence to take action, and authorized an operation to get Osama bin Laden and bring him to justice.<br /><b>Today, at my direction, the United States launched a targeted operation against that compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. A small team of Americans carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability.</b> No Americans were harmed. They took care to avoid civilian casualties. After a firefight, they killed Osama bin Laden and took custody of his body.</li></ul><ul><li><b>For over two decades, bin Laden has been al Qaeda’s leader and symbol, and has continued to plot attacks against our country and our friends and allies. The death of bin Laden marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation’s effort to defeat al Qaeda.<br />Yet his death does not mark the end of our effort.</b> There’s no doubt that al Qaeda will continue to pursue attacks against us. We must — and we will — remain vigilant at home and abroad.<br />As we do, we must also reaffirm that the United States is not — and never will be — at war with Islam. I’ve made clear, just as President <a href="/wiki/George_W._Bush" title="George W. Bush">Bush</a> did shortly after 9/11, that our war is not against Islam. <b>Bin Laden was not a Muslim leader; he was a mass murderer of Muslims. Indeed, al Qaeda has slaughtered scores of Muslims in many countries, including our own. So his demise should be welcomed by all who believe in peace and human dignity.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>The American people did not choose this fight. It came to our shores, and started with the senseless slaughter of our citizens.</b> After nearly 10 years of service, struggle, and sacrifice, we know well the costs of war. These efforts weigh on me every time I, as Commander-in-Chief, have to sign a letter to a family that has lost a loved one, or look into the eyes of a service member who’s been gravely wounded.<br />So Americans understand the costs of war. Yet as a country, we will never tolerate our security being threatened, nor stand idly by when our people have been killed. We will be relentless in defense of our citizens and our friends and allies. We will be true to the values that make us who we are. And on nights like this one, we can say to those families who have lost loved ones to al Qaeda’s terror: Justice has been done.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Tonight, we give thanks to the countless intelligence and counterterrorism professionals who’ve worked tirelessly to achieve this outcome.</b> The American people do not see their work, nor know their names. But tonight, they feel the satisfaction of their work and the result of their pursuit of justice.<br />We give thanks for the men who carried out this operation, for they exemplify the professionalism, patriotism, and unparalleled courage of those who serve our country.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Tonight, let us think back to the sense of unity that prevailed on 9/11.</b> I know that it has, at times, frayed. Yet today’s achievement is a testament to the greatness of our country and the determination of the American people.<br />The cause of securing our country is not complete. But tonight, we are once again reminded that America can do whatever we set our mind to. That is the story of our history, whether it’s the pursuit of prosperity for our people, or the struggle for equality for all our citizens; our commitment to stand up for our values abroad, and our sacrifices to make the world a safer place.<br /><b>Let us remember that we can do these things not just because of wealth or power, but because of who we are: one nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.</b><br />Thank you. May God bless you. And may God bless the United States of America.</li></ul><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="UN_speech_to_General_Assembly_.28September_2011.29">UN speech to General Assembly (September 2011)</span></h4><dl><dd><small><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2011/09/21/remarks-president-obama-address-united-nations-general-assembly">Remarks by President Obama in Address to the United Nations General Assembly, September 21, 2011</a></small></dd></dl><ul><li>America’s commitment to Israel’s security is unshakeable.

Israel’s citizens have been killed by rockets fired at their houses and suicide bombs on their buses. Israel’s children come of age knowing that throughout the region, other children are taught to hate them. Israel, a small country of less than eight million people, looks out at a world where leaders of much larger nations threaten to wipe it off of the map.

And the question for us is clear: Will we stand with the Syrian people, or with their oppressors?</li></ul><ul><li>Already, the United States has imposed strong sanctions on Syria’s leaders. We supported a transfer of power that is responsive to the Syrian people. And many of our allies have joined in this effort. But for the sake of Syria -- and the peace and security of the world -- we must speak with one voice. There's no excuse for inaction.

If you say earlier in the year, "I'm gonna give a tax cut to the top 1%", and in a debate you say, "I don't know anything about giving tax cuts to rich folks", you need to get a thermometer, take your temperature, because you've probably got Romnesia.</p><p>If you say that you're a champion of the coal industry when, while you were governor, you stood in front of a coal plant and said "This plant will kill you" —[audience: Romnesia!] that's some Romnesia.</p><p>And if you come down with a case of Romnesia and you can't seem to remember the policies that are still on your website, or the promises you've made over the six years you've been running for President, here's the good news: Obamacare covers pre-existing conditions.

That’s why freedom is not an abstract idea; freedom is the very thing that makes human progress possible -- not just at the ballot box, but in our daily lives.</b><br />One of our greatest Presidents in the United States, <a href="/wiki/Franklin_Delano_Roosevelt" title="Franklin Delano Roosevelt" class="mw-redirect">Franklin Delano Roosevelt</a>, understood this truth. He defined America’s cause as more than the right to cast a ballot. He understood democracy was not just voting. He called upon the world to embrace four fundamental freedoms: <b>freedom of speech, freedom of worship, freedom from want, and freedom from fear. These four freedoms reinforce one another, and you cannot fully realize one without realizing them all.</b></li></ul><ul><li>And <b>to protect the freedom of all the voters, those in power must accept constraints.</b> That's what our American system is designed to do. Now, <b>America may have the strongest military in the world, but it must submit to civilian control. I, as the President of the United States, make determinations that the military then carries out, not the other way around. As President and Commander-In-Chief, I have that responsibility because I'm accountable to the people.</b></li></ul><ul><li>Now, on other hand, as President, I cannot just impose my will on Congress -- the Congress of the United States -- even though sometimes I wish I could. The legislative branch has its own powers and its own prerogatives, and so they check my power and balance my power. I appoint some of our judges, but I cannot tell them how to rule, because every person in America -- from a child living in poverty to me, the President of the United States -- is equal under the law. And a judge can make a determination as to whether or not I am upholding the law or breaking the law. And I am fully accountable to that law.</li></ul><ul><li><b>It's not enough to trade a prison of powerlessness for the pain of an empty stomach.</b> But history shows that <a href="/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln" title="Abraham Lincoln">governments of the people and by the people and for the people</a> more powerful in delivering prosperity.</li></ul><ul><li><b>When ordinary people have a say in their own future, then your land can’t just be taken away from you.</b></li></ul><ul><li>And that kind of <b>economic growth, where everybody has opportunity</b> -- if you work hard, you can succeed -- that's what gets a nation moving rapidly when it comes to develop. But that kind of growth <b>can only be created if corruption is left behind. For investment to lead to opportunity, reform must promote budgets that are transparent and industry that is privately owned.</b></li></ul><ul><li>Above all, when your voices are heard in government, it's far more likely that your basic needs will be met. And that’s why reform must reach the daily lives of those who are hungry and those who are ill, and those who live without electricity or water.</li></ul><ul><li>And let us remember that in a global economy, <b>a country’s greatest resource is its people.</b> So by investing in you, this nation can open the door for far more prosperity -- because <b>unlocking a nation’s potential depends on empowering all its people, especially its young people.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>No process of reform will succeed without national reconciliation.</b> [...] National reconciliation will take time, but for the sake of our common humanity, and for the sake of this country’s future, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_conflict_in_Burma" class="extiw" title="w:Internal conflict in Burma">it is necessary to stop incitement and to stop violence</a>.</li></ul><ul><li>Every nation struggles to define citizenship. America has had great debates about these issues, and those debates continue to this day, because we’re a nation of immigrants -- people coming from every different part of the world. But what we’ve learned in the United States is that there are certain principles that are universal, apply to everybody no matter what you look like, no matter where you come from, no matter what religion you practice. The right of people to live without the threat that their families may be harmed or their homes may be burned simply because of who they are or where they come from. Only the people of this country ultimately can define your union, can define what it means to be a citizen of this country. But I have confidence that as you do that you can draw on this diversity as a strength and not a weakness. Your country will be stronger because of many different cultures, but you have to seize that opportunity. You have to recognize that strength.</li></ul><ul><li>In many ways, <b>fear is the force that stands between human beings and their dreams. Fear of conflict and the weapons of war. Fear of a future that is different from the past. Fear of changes that are reordering our societies and economy. Fear of people who look different, or come from a different place, or worship in a different way.</b> In some of her darkest moments, when Aung San Suu Kyi was imprisoned, she wrote an essay about freedom from fear. She said fear of losing corrupts those who wield it -- “Fear of losing power corrupts those who wield it, and fear of the scourge of power corrupts those who are subject to it.” That's the fear that you can leave behind. We see that chance in leaders who are beginning to understand that <b>power comes from appealing to people’s hopes, not people's fears.</b></li></ul><ul><li>As one former prisoner put it in speaking to his fellow citizens, “Politics is your job. It’s not only for [the] politicians.” And we have an expression in the United States that <b>the most important office in a democracy is the office of citizen -- not President, not Speaker, but citizen.</b></li></ul><ul><li>You're the ones who are going to have to seize freedom, because <b>a true revolution of the spirit begins in each of our hearts.</b></li></ul><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Remarks_after_Sandy_Hook_killings_.28December_2012.29">Remarks after <a href="/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting" title="Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting">Sandy Hook killings</a> (December 2012)</span></h4><div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:222px;"><a href="/wiki/File:Police_at_Sandy_Hook.PNG" class="image"><img alt="" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Police_at_Sandy_Hook.PNG/220px-Police_at_Sandy_Hook.PNG" width="220" height="148" class="thumbimage" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Police_at_Sandy_Hook.PNG/330px-Police_at_Sandy_Hook.PNG 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/46/Police_at_Sandy_Hook.PNG/440px-Police_at_Sandy_Hook.PNG 2x" data-file-width="636" data-file-height="427" /></a><div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/wiki/File:Police_at_Sandy_Hook.PNG" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div>As a country, we have been through this too many times.</div></div></div><dl><dd><small><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2012-12-14/politics/35846745_1_parent-children-transcript">Televised remarks (14 December 2012)</a></small></dd></dl><ul><li><b>As a country, we have been through this too many times.</b> Whether it is <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandy_Hook_Elementary_School_shooting" class="extiw" title="w:Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting">an elementary school in Newtown</a>, or <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clackamas_Town_Center_shooting" class="extiw" title="w:Clackamas Town Center shooting">a shopping mall in Oregon</a>, or <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wisconsin_Sikh_temple_shooting" class="extiw" title="w:Wisconsin Sikh temple shooting">a temple in Wisconsin</a>, or <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2012_Aurora_shooting" class="extiw" title="w:2012 Aurora shooting">a movie theater in Aurora</a>, or <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.nbcchicago.com/blogs/ward-room/Obama-Includes-Street-In-Chicago-In-List-of-Tragedies-183542101.html">a street corner in Chicago</a>, these neighborhoods are our neighborhoods and these children are our children.

They lost their lives in a school that could have been any school in a quiet town full of good and decent people that could be any town in America.<br />Here in Newtown, I come to offer the love and prayers of a nation. I am very mindful that mere words cannot match the depths of your sorrow, nor can they heal your wounded hearts.<br />I can only hope it helps for you to know that you’re not alone in your grief, that our world, too, has been torn apart, that all across this land of ours, we have wept with you. We’ve pulled our children tight.<br />And you must know that whatever measure of comfort we can provide, we will provide. Whatever portion of sadness that we can share with you to ease this heavy load, we will gladly bear it. Newtown, you are not alone.</li><li>As a community, you’ve inspired us, Newtown. In the face of indescribable violence, in the face of unconscionable evil, you’ve looked out for each other. You’ve cared for one another. And you’ve loved one another. This is how Newtown will be remembered, and with time and God’s grace, that love will see you through.<br />But we as a nation, we are left with some hard questions.</li></ul><ul><li>It comes as a shock at a certain point where you realize no matter how much you love these kids, you can’t do it by yourself, that this job of keeping our children safe and teaching them well is something we can only do together, with the help of friends and neighbors, the help of a community and the help of a nation.<br />And in that way we come to realize that we bear responsibility for every child, because we’re counting on everybody else to help look after ours, that we’re all parents, that they are all our children.<br />This is our first task, caring for our children. It’s our first job. If we don’t get that right, we don’t get anything right. That’s how, as a society, we will be judged.</li></ul><ul><li>Can we honestly say that we’re doing enough to keep our children, all of them, safe from harm?<br />Can we claim, as a nation, that we’re all together there, letting them know they are loved and teaching them to love in return?<br />Can we say that we’re truly doing enough to give all the children of this country the chance they deserve to live out their lives in happiness and with purpose?<br />I’ve been reflecting on this the last few days, and if we’re honest with ourselves, the answer’s no. We’re not doing enough. And we will have to change. Since I’ve been president, this is the fourth time we have come together to comfort a grieving community torn apart by mass shootings, fourth time we’ve hugged survivors, the fourth time we’ve consoled the families of victims.<br />And in between, there have been an endless series of deadly shootings across the country, almost daily reports of victims, many of them children, in small towns and in big cities all across America, victims whose — much of the time their only fault was being at the wrong place at the wrong time.<br /><b>We can’t tolerate this anymore.

For <b>history tells us that while these truths may be self-evident, they’ve never been self-executing</b>; that <b>while <a href="/wiki/Freedom" title="Freedom">freedom</a> is a gift from <a href="/wiki/God" title="God">God</a>, it must be secured by His people here on Earth.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Revolution" class="extiw" title="w:American Revolution">The patriots of 1776</a> did not fight to replace the tyranny of a king with the privileges of a few or the rule of a mob. &#160;They gave to us a republic, <a href="/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln#The_Gettysburg_Address_.281863.29" title="Abraham Lincoln">a government of, and by, and for the people</a>, entrusting each generation to keep safe our founding creed. And for more than two hundred years, we have.</b>&#160;Through <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavery_in_the_United_States" class="extiw" title="w:Slavery in the United States">blood drawn by lash</a> and <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War" class="extiw" title="w:American Civil War">blood drawn by sword</a>, we learned that no <a href="/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln#The_Gettysburg_Address_.281863.29" title="Abraham Lincoln">union founded on the principles</a> of <a href="/wiki/Liberty" title="Liberty">liberty</a> and <a href="/wiki/Equality" title="Equality">equality</a> could survive <a href="/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln#The_House_Divided_speech_.281858.29" title="Abraham Lincoln">half-slave and half-free</a>. We made ourselves anew, and vowed to move forward together.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Together, we discovered that a free market only thrives when there are rules to ensure competition and fair play. Together, we resolved that a great nation must care for the vulnerable, and protect its people from life’s worst hazards and misfortune.&#160;Through it all, we have never relinquished our <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anti_Federalism" class="extiw" title="w:Anti Federalism">skepticism of central authority</a>, nor have we succumbed to the fiction that all society’s ills can be cured through government alone.</b> &#160;</li></ul><ul><li>Our celebration of initiative and enterprise, our insistence on hard work and personal responsibility, these are constants in our character. But we have always understood that <b>when times change, so must we</b>; that <b>fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to new challenges</b>; that <b>preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action</b>. For the American people can no more meet the demands of today’s world by acting alone than American soldiers could have met the forces of <a href="/wiki/Fascism" title="Fascism">fascism</a> or <a href="/wiki/Communism" title="Communism">communism</a> with <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musket" class="extiw" title="w:Musket">muskets</a> and <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Militia" class="extiw" title="w:Militia">militias</a>. No single person can train all the math and science teachers we’ll need to equip our children for the future, or build the roads and networks and research labs that will bring new jobs and businesses to our shores. <b>Now, more than ever, we must do</b> these <b>things together, as one nation and one people.</b></li></ul><ul><li>This generation of Americans has been tested by crises that steeled our resolve and proved our resilience. [...] America’s possibilities are limitless, for <b>we possess all the qualities that this world without boundaries demands: youth and drive; diversity and openness; an endless capacity for risk and a gift for reinvention.</b> My fellow Americans, <b>we are made for this moment, and we will seize it -- so long as we seize it together. For <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preamble_to_the_United_States_Constitution" class="extiw" title="w:Preamble to the United States Constitution">we, the people</a>, understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it.</b> We believe that America’s prosperity must rest upon the broad shoulders of a rising middle class.&#160;We know that America thrives when every person can find independence and pride in their work; when the wages of honest labor liberate families from the brink of hardship. <b>We are true to our creed when a little girl born into the bleakest poverty knows that she has the same chance to succeed as anybody else, because she is an American; she is free, and she is equal, not just in the eyes of God but also in our own.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preamble_to_the_United_States_Constitution" class="extiw" title="w:Preamble to the United States Constitution">We, the people</a>, still believe that every citizen deserves a basic measure of security and dignity.</b> &#160;We must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care and the size of our deficit. But we reject the belief that America must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future. &#160;For we remember the lessons of our past, when twilight years were spent in poverty and parents of a child with a disability had nowhere to turn.&#160;</li></ul><ul><li><b>We do not believe that in this country freedom is reserved for the lucky, or happiness for the few.</b> We recognize that no matter how responsibly we live our lives, any one of us at any time may face a job loss, or a sudden illness, or a home swept away in <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hurricane_Sandy" class="extiw" title="w:Hurricane Sandy">a terrible storm</a>. <b>The commitments we make to each other</b> through <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare" class="extiw" title="w:Medicare">Medicare</a> and <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid" class="extiw" title="w:Medicaid">Medicaid</a> and <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_Security_(United_States)" class="extiw" title="w:Social Security (United States)">Social Security</a>, <b>these things do not sap our initiative, they strengthen us.&#160;They do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>We, the people, still believe that our obligations as Americans are not just to ourselves, but to all posterity.</b> &#160;We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations.&#160;Some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires and crippling drought and more powerful storms. The path towards sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult. But America cannot resist this transition, we must lead it. We cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries, we must claim its promise. That’s how we will maintain our economic vitality and our national treasure -- our forests and waterways, our crop lands and snow-capped peaks. That is how we will preserve our planet, commanded to our care by God. <b>That’s what will lend meaning to <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Life,_liberty_and_the_pursuit_of_happiness#Origin_and_phrasing" class="extiw" title="w:Life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness">the creed our fathers</a> <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Preamble_to_the_United_States_Constitution#Text" class="extiw" title="w:Preamble to the United States Constitution">once declared</a>.</b></li></ul><ul><li>We, the people, still believe that <b>enduring security and lasting peace do not require perpetual war.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>We will defend our people and uphold our values through strength of arms and rule of law.</b> &#160;We will show the courage to try and resolve our differences with other nations peacefully –- not because we are naïve about the dangers we face, but because <b>engagement can more durably lift suspicion and fear. America will remain the anchor of strong alliances in every corner of the globe. &#160;And we will renew those institutions that extend our capacity to manage crisis abroad, for no one has a greater stake in a peaceful world than its most powerful nation.</b> We will support democracy from Asia to Africa, from the Americas to the Middle East, because our interests and our conscience compel us to act on behalf of those who long for freedom. &#160;And we must be a source of hope to the poor, the sick, the marginalized, the victims of prejudice –- not out of mere charity, but because <b>peace in our time requires the constant advance of those principles that our common creed describes: tolerance and opportunity, human dignity and justice.</b></li></ul><ul><li>We, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths –- that <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_men_are_created_equal" class="extiw" title="w:All men are created equal">all of us are created equal</a> –- is the star that guides us still; just as it guided our forebears through <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seneca_Falls_Convention" class="extiw" title="w:Seneca Falls Convention">Seneca Falls</a> and <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selma_to_Montgomery_marches" class="extiw" title="w:Selma to Montgomery marches">Selma</a> and <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots" class="extiw" title="w:Stonewall riots">Stonewall</a>; just as it guided all those men and women, sung and unsung, who left footprints along <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Mall" class="extiw" title="w:National Mall">this great Mall</a>, to hear <a href="/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr.#I_Have_A_Dream_.281963.29" title="Martin Luther King, Jr.">a preacher say that we cannot walk alone; to hear a King proclaim that our individual freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on Earth.</a> &#160;</li></ul><ul><li>It is now our generation’s task to carry on what those pioneers began.

It is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country — the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead, no matter where you come from, no matter what you look like, or who you love. It is our unfinished task to make sure that this government works on behalf of the many, and not just the few; that it encourages free enterprise, rewards individual initiative, and opens the doors of opportunity to every child across this great nation.</li></ul><ul><li>The American people don’t expect government to solve every problem. They don’t expect those of us in this chamber to agree on every issue. But they do expect us to put the nation’s interests before party. They do expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can. For they know that <b>America moves forward only when we do so together, and that the responsibility of improving this union remains the task of us all.</b></li></ul><ul><li>I realize that tax reform and entitlement reform will not be easy. The politics will be hard for both sides. None of us will get 100 percent of what we want. But the alternative will cost us jobs, hurt our economy, visit hardship on millions of hardworking Americans. So let’s set party interests aside and work to pass a budget that replaces reckless cuts with smart savings and wise investments in our future. And let’s do it without the brinksmanship that stresses consumers and scares off investors. <b>The greatest nation on Earth cannot keep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next.</b> We can’t do it. Let’s agree right here, right now to keep the people’s government open, and pay our bills on time, and always uphold the full faith and credit of the United States of America. <b>The American people have worked too hard, for too long, rebuilding from one crisis to see their elected officials cause another.</b></li></ul><ul><li>And we’ll work to strengthen families by removing the financial deterrents to marriage for low-income couples, and do more to encourage fatherhood — because <b>what makes you a man isn’t the ability to conceive a child; it’s having the courage to raise one.</b></li></ul><ul><li>Stronger families. Stronger communities. A stronger America. It is this kind of <b>prosperity — broad, shared, built on a thriving middle class</b> — that <b>has always been the source of our progress at home. It’s also the foundation of our power and influence throughout the world.</b></li></ul><ul><li>At the same time, we’ll engage Russia to seek further reductions in our nuclear arsenals, and continue leading the global effort to secure nuclear materials that could fall into the wrong hands — because <b>our ability to influence others depends on our willingness to lead and meet our obligations.</b></li></ul><ul><li>We may do different jobs and wear different uniforms, and hold different views than the person beside us. But as Americans, <b>we all share the same proud title — we are citizens. It’s a word that doesn’t just describe our nationality or legal status. It describes the way we’re made. It describes what we believe.

Many had gone to segregated schools and sat at segregated lunch counters. They lived in towns where they couldn’t vote and cities where their votes didn’t matter. They were couples in love who couldn’t marry, soldiers who fought for freedom abroad that they found denied to them at home. They had seen loved ones beaten, and children fire-hosed, and they had every reason to lash out in anger, or resign themselves to a bitter fate.<p><b>And yet they chose a different path. In the face of hatred, they prayed for their tormentors. In the face of violence, they stood up and sat in, with the moral force of nonviolence. Willingly, they went to jail to protest unjust laws, their cells swelling with the sound of freedom songs. A lifetime of indignities had taught them that no man can take away the dignity and grace that <a href="/wiki/God" title="God">God</a> grants us. They had learned through hard experience what <a href="/wiki/Frederick_Douglass" title="Frederick Douglass">Frederick Douglass</a> once taught -- that freedom is not given, it must be won, through struggle and discipline, persistence and faith.</b></p></li></ul><ul><li>And because they kept marching, America changed.

Because they marched, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voting_Rights_Act_of_1965" class="extiw" title="w:Voting Rights Act of 1965">a Voting Rights law was signed</a>. Because they marched, doors of opportunity and education swung open so their daughters and sons could finally imagine a life for themselves beyond washing somebody else’s laundry or shining somebody else’s shoes. Because they marched, city councils changed and state legislatures changed, and Congress changed, and, yes, eventually, the White House changed. Because they marched, America became more free and more fair -- not just for African Americans, but for women and Latinos, Asians and Native Americans; for Catholics, Jews, and Muslims; for gays, for Americans with a disability. America changed for you and for me. and the entire world drew strength from that example, whether the young people who watched from the other side of an <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron_Curtain" class="extiw" title="w:Iron Curtain">Iron Curtain</a> and would eventually <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irontear_down_Curtain#Fall_of_the_Iron_Curtain" class="extiw" title="w:Irontear down Curtain">tear down that wall</a>, or the young people inside South Africa who would eventually end <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apartheid_in_South_Africa" class="extiw" title="w:Apartheid in South Africa">the scourge of apartheid</a>.</li></ul><ul><li>Those are the victories they won, with iron wills and hope in their hearts. That is the transformation that they wrought, with each step of their well-worn shoes. That’s the debt that I and millions of Americans owe those maids, those laborers, those porters, those secretaries; folks who could have run a company maybe if they had ever had a chance; those white students who put themselves in harm’s way, even though they didn't have; those <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_American_internment" class="extiw" title="w:Japanese American internment">Japanese Americans who recalled their own internment</a>; those Jewish Americans who had survived the <a href="/wiki/Holocaust" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>; people who could have given up and given in, but kept on keeping on, knowing that “<a href="/wiki/Psalms#Psalm_30" title="Psalms">weeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning.</a>”</li></ul><ul><li><b>On the battlefield of justice, men and women without rank or wealth or title or fame would liberate us all in ways that our children now take for granted, as people of all colors and creeds live together and learn together and walk together, and fight alongside one another, and love one another, and judge one another by the content of our character in this greatest nation on Earth.</b></li></ul><ul><li>To dismiss the magnitude of this progress -- to suggest, as some sometimes do, that little has changed -- that dishonors the courage and the sacrifice of those who paid the price to march in those years. <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medgar_Evers" class="extiw" title="w:Medgar Evers">Medgar Evers</a>, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Chaney" class="extiw" title="w:James Chaney">James Chaney</a>, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Goodman" class="extiw" title="w:Andrew Goodman">Andrew Goodman</a>, <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Schwerner" class="extiw" title="w:Michael Schwerner">Michael Schwerner</a>, Martin Luther King Jr. -- they did not die in vain.

But we would dishonor those heroes as well to suggest that the work of this nation is somehow complete. <b>The arc of the moral universe may bend towards justice, but it doesn’t bend on its own. To secure the gains this country has made requires constant vigilance, not complacency. Whether by challenging those who erect new barriers to the vote, or ensuring that the scales of justice work equally for all, and the criminal justice system is not simply a pipeline from underfunded schools to overcrowded jails, it requires vigilance. And we'll suffer the occasional setback. But we will win these fights.</b> This country has changed too much. <b>People of goodwill, regardless of party, are too plentiful for those with ill will to change history’s currents.</b></li></ul><ul><li>In some ways, though, the securing of civil rights, voting rights, the eradication of legalized discrimination -- the very significance of these victories may have obscured a second goal of the March. For <b>the men and women who gathered 50 years ago were</b> not there in search of some abstract ideal. They were there <b>seeking jobs as well as justice, not just the absence of oppression but the presence of economic opportunity. For what does it profit a man</b>, Dr. King would ask, <b>to sit at an integrated lunch counter if he can’t afford the meal? This idea -- that one’s liberty is linked to one’s livelihood; that the pursuit of happiness requires the dignity of work, the skills to find work, decent pay, some measure of material security -- this idea was not new.</b> Lincoln himself understood the Declaration of Independence in such terms -- as a promise that in due time, “<a href="/wiki/Abraham_Lincoln#1860s" title="Abraham Lincoln">the weights should be lifted from the shoulders of all men, and that all should have an equal chance.</a>”</li></ul><ul><li>The test was not, and never has been, whether the doors of opportunity are cracked a bit wider for a few. It was whether our economic system provides a fair shot for the many -- for the black custodian and the white steelworker, the immigrant dishwasher and the Native American veteran. <b>To win that battle, to answer that call -- this remains our great unfinished business.</b></li></ul><ul><li>We can continue down our current path, in which the gears of this great democracy grind to a halt and our children accept a life of lower expectations; where politics is a zero-sum game where a few do very well while struggling families of every race fight over a shrinking economic pie -- that’s one path. Or we can have the courage to change.</li></ul><ul><li><b>The March on Washington teaches us that we are not trapped by the mistakes of history; that we are masters of our fate. But it also teaches us that the promise of this nation will only be kept when we work together.</b> We’ll have to reignite the embers of empathy and fellow feeling, the coalition of conscience that found expression in this place 50 years ago. And I believe that spirit is there, that truth force inside each of us. I see it when a white mother recognizes her own daughter in the face of a poor black child. I see it when the black youth thinks of his own grandfather in the dignified steps of an elderly white man. It’s there when the native-born recognizing that striving spirit of the new immigrant; when the interracial couple connects the pain of a gay couple who are discriminated against and understands it as their own. <b>That’s where courage comes from -- when we turn not from each other, or on each other, but towards one another, and we find that we do not walk alone. That’s where courage comes from.</b></li></ul><ul><li>America, <b>I know the road will be long, but I know we can get there. Yes, we will stumble, but I know we’ll get back up. That’s how a movement happens. That’s how history bends. That's how when somebody is faint of heart, somebody else brings them along and says, come on, we’re marching.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>There’s a reason why so many who marched that day, and in the days to come, were young -- for the young are unconstrained by habits of fear, unconstrained by the conventions of what is.</b> They dared to dream differently, to imagine something better. And I am convinced that same imagination, the same hunger of purpose stirs in this generation. We might not face the same dangers of 1963, but the fierce urgency of now remains.

And while we don’t promise equal outcomes, we have strived to deliver equal opportunity -- the idea that <b>success doesn’t depend on being born into wealth or privilege, it depends on effort and merit.</b> And with every chapter we’ve added to that story, we’ve worked hard to put those words into practice.</li></ul><ul><li>So let me repeat: <b>The combined trends of increased inequality and decreasing mobility pose a fundamental threat to the American Dream, our way of life, and what we stand for around the globe.</b> And it is not simply a moral claim that I’m making here. <b>There are practical consequences to rising inequality and reduced mobility.</b> For one thing, these trends are bad for our economy. One study finds that <b>growth is more fragile and recessions are more frequent in countries with greater inequality.</b> And that makes sense. <b>When families have less to spend, that means businesses have fewer customers, and households rack up greater mortgage and credit card debt; meanwhile, concentrated wealth at the top is less likely to result in the kind of broadly based consumer spending that drives our economy, and together with lax regulation, may contribute to risky speculative bubbles.</b></li></ul><ul><li>And <b>rising inequality and declining mobility are also bad for</b> our <b>families and social cohesion -- not just because we tend to trust our institutions less, but</b> studies show <b>we actually tend to trust each other less when there’s greater inequality. And greater inequality is associated with less mobility between generations. That means it’s not just temporary; the effects last. It creates a vicious cycle. For example, by the time she turns three years old, a child born into a low-income home hears 30 million fewer words than a child from a well-off family, which means by the time she starts school she’s already behind, and that deficit can compound itself over time.</b></li></ul><ul><li>And finally, <b>rising inequality and declining mobility are bad for</b> our <b>democracy. Ordinary folks can’t write massive campaign checks or hire high-priced lobbyists and lawyers to secure policies that tilt the playing field in their favor at everyone else’s expense. And so people get the bad taste that the system is rigged, and that increases cynicism and polarization, and it decreases the political participation that is a requisite part of our system of self-government.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>It’s true that government cannot prevent all the downsides of the technological change and global competition</b> that are out there right now, and some of those forces are also some of the things that are helping us grow. And <b>it’s also true that some programs in the past, like welfare before it was reformed, were sometimes poorly designed, created disincentives to work. But we’ve also seen how government action time and again can make an enormous difference in increasing opportunity and bolstering ladders into the middle class. Investments in education, laws establishing collective bargaining, and a minimum wage -- these all contributed to rising standards of living</b> for massive numbers of Americans.</li></ul><ul><li>It was <b><a href="/wiki/Adam_Smith" title="Adam Smith">Adam Smith</a>, the father of free-market economics,</b> who <b>once said, “They who feed, clothe, and lodge the whole body of the people should have such a share of the produce of their own labor as to be themselves tolerably well fed, clothed, and lodged.”</b> And for those of you who don’t speak old-English let me translate. <b>It means if you work hard, you should make a decent living. If you work hard, you should be able to support a family.</b></li></ul><ul><li>I realize <b>we are not going to resolve all of our political debates over the best ways to reduce inequality and increase upward mobility this year, or next year, or in the next five years. But it is important that we have a serious debate about these issues. For the longer that current trends are allowed to continue, the more it will feed the cynicism and fear that many Americans are feeling right now -- that they’ll never be able to repay the debt they took on to go to college, they’ll never be able to save enough to retire, they’ll never see their own children land a good job that supports a family.</b></li></ul><ul><li>If you still don’t like Obamacare -- and I know you don’t even though it’s built on market-based ideas of choice and competition in the private sector, then you should explain how, exactly, you’d cut costs, and cover more people, and make insurance more secure. <b>You owe it to the American people to tell us what you are for, not just what you’re against. That way we can have a vigorous and meaningful debate. That’s what the American people deserve. That’s what the times demand. It’s not enough anymore to just say we should just get our government out of the way and let the unfettered market take care of it -- for our experience tells us that’s just not true.</b></li></ul><ul><li>Look, <b>I’ve never believed that government can solve every problem or should</b> -- and neither do you. We know that <b>ultimately our strength is grounded in our people -- individuals out there, striving, working, making things happen. It depends on community, a rich and generous sense of community</b> -- that’s at the core of what happens at THEARC here every day. You understand that <b>turning back rising inequality and expanding opportunity requires parents taking responsibility for their kids, kids taking responsibility to work hard. It requires religious leaders who mobilize their congregations to rebuild neighborhoods block by block, requires civic organizations that can help train the unemployed, link them with businesses for the jobs of the future. It requires companies and CEOs to set an example by providing decent wages, and salaries, and benefits for their workers, and a shot for somebody who is down on his or her luck. We know that’s our strength -- our people, our communities, our businesses. But government can’t stand on the sidelines in our efforts. Because government is us. It can and should reflect our deepest values and commitments.</b> And if we refocus our energies on building an economy that grows for everybody, and gives every child in this country a fair chance at success, then I remain confident that the future still looks brighter than the past, and that the best days for this country we love are still ahead.</li></ul><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Eulogy_of_Nelson_Mandela_.28December_2013.29">Eulogy of Nelson Mandela (December 2013)</span></h4><div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:222px;"><a href="/wiki/File:Bust_Of_Nelson_Mandela-Royal_Festival_Hall-London.JPG" class="image"><img alt="" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Bust_Of_Nelson_Mandela-Royal_Festival_Hall-London.JPG/220px-Bust_Of_Nelson_Mandela-Royal_Festival_Hall-London.JPG" width="220" height="237" class="thumbimage" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Bust_Of_Nelson_Mandela-Royal_Festival_Hall-London.JPG/330px-Bust_Of_Nelson_Mandela-Royal_Festival_Hall-London.JPG 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/89/Bust_Of_Nelson_Mandela-Royal_Festival_Hall-London.JPG/440px-Bust_Of_Nelson_Mandela-Royal_Festival_Hall-London.JPG 2x" data-file-width="744" data-file-height="800" /></a><div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/wiki/File:Bust_Of_Nelson_Mandela-Royal_Festival_Hall-London.JPG" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div>Action and ideas are not enough.

He understood that <b>ideas cannot be contained by prison walls, or extinguished by a sniper’s bullet.</b> He turned his trial into an indictment of apartheid because of his eloquence and his passion, but also because of his training as an advocate. He used decades in prison to sharpen his arguments, but also to spread his thirst for knowledge to others in the movement. And he learned the language and the customs of his oppressor so that one day he might better convey to them how their own freedom depend upon his.</li></ul><ul><li>Mandela demonstrated that <b>action and ideas are not enough. No matter how right, they must be chiseled into law and institutions.</b></li></ul><ul><li>It took a man like Madiba to free not just the prisoner, but the jailer as well to show that <b>you must trust others so that they may trust you</b>; to teach that <b>reconciliation is not a matter of ignoring a cruel past, but a means of confronting it with inclusion and generosity and truth.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>The struggles that follow the victory of formal equality or universal franchise may not be as filled with drama and moral clarity as those that came before, but they are no less important.</b> For around the world today, we still see children suffering from hunger and disease. We still see run-down schools. We still see young people without prospects for the future. Around the world today, men and women are still imprisoned for their political beliefs, and are still persecuted for what they look like, and how they worship, and who they love. That is happening today. <b>And so we, too, must act on behalf of justice. We, too, must act on behalf of peace.</b> There are too many people who happily embrace Madiba’s legacy of racial reconciliation, but passionately resist even modest reforms that would challenge chronic poverty and growing inequality. There are too many leaders who claim solidarity with Madiba’s struggle for freedom, but do not tolerate dissent from their own people. And there are too many of us on the sidelines, comfortable in complacency or cynicism when our voices must be heard.</li></ul><ul><li>The questions we face today -- how to promote equality and justice; how to uphold freedom and human rights; how to end conflict and sectarian war -- these things do not have easy answers. But there were no easy answers in front of that child born in World War I. Nelson Mandela reminds us that <b>it always seems impossible until it is done.</b> South Africa shows that is true.

[…] intelligence agencies cannot function without secrecy, which makes their work less subject to public debate. Yet there is an inevitable bias not only within the intelligence community, but among all of us who are responsible for national security, to collect more information about the world, not less. So in the absence of institutional requirements for regular debate -- and oversight that is public, as well as private or classified -- the danger of government overreach becomes more acute. And this is particularly true when surveillance technology and our reliance on digital information is evolving much faster than</b> our <b>laws.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>[T]he combination of increased digital information and powerful supercomputers offers intelligence agencies the possibility of sifting through massive amounts of bulk data to identify patterns or pursue leads that may thwart impending threats.</b> It’s a powerful tool. <b>But the government collection and storage of such bulk data also creates a potential for abuse.</b></li></ul><ul><li>I indicated in a speech at the National Defense University last May that we needed a more robust public discussion about the balance between security and liberty. Of course, what I did not know at the time is that within weeks of my speech, an avalanche of unauthorized disclosures would spark controversies at home and abroad that have continued to this day. And given the fact of an open investigation, I’m not going to dwell on <a href="/wiki/Edward_Snowden" title="Edward Snowden">Mr. Snowden</a>’s actions or his motivations; I will say that <b>our nation’s defense depends in part on the fidelity of those entrusted with our nation’s secrets. If any individual who objects to government policy can take it into their own hands to publicly disclose classified information, then we will not be able to keep our people safe, or conduct foreign policy.</b> Moreover, the sensational way in which <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_surveillance_disclosures_(2013%E2%80%93present)" class="extiw" title="w:Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)">these disclosures</a> have come out has often shed more heat than light, while revealing methods to our adversaries that could impact our operations in ways that we may not fully understand for years to come.</li></ul><ul><li>There was a recognition by all who participated in these reviews that the <b>challenges to our privacy do not come from government alone. Corporations of all shapes and sizes track what you buy, store and analyze our data, and use it for commercial purposes</b>; that’s how those targeted ads pop up on your computer and your smartphone periodically. <b>But all of us understand that the standards for government surveillance must be higher. Given the unique power of the state, it is not enough for leaders to say: Trust us, we won’t abuse the data we collect. For history has too many examples when that trust has been breached. Our system of government is built on the premise that our liberty cannot depend on the good intentions of those in power; it depends on the law to constrain those in power.</b></li></ul><ul><li>What’s at stake in this debate goes far beyond a few months of headlines, or passing tensions in our foreign policy. When you cut through the noise, what’s really at stake is how we remain true to who we are in a world that is remaking itself at dizzying speed. Whether it’s the ability of individuals to communicate ideas; to access information that would have once filled every great library in every country in the world; or to forge bonds with people on other sides of the globe, technology is remaking what is possible for individuals, and for institutions, and for the international order. So while the reforms that I have announced will point us in a new direction, I am mindful that more work will be needed in the future. One thing I’m certain of: This debate will make us stronger. And I also know that in this time of change, the United States of America will have to lead. It may seem sometimes that America is being held to a different standard. And I'll admit the readiness of some to assume the worst motives by our government can be frustrating. No one expects China to have an open debate about their surveillance programs, or Russia to take privacy concerns of citizens in other places into account. But let’s remember: We are held to a different standard precisely because we have been at the forefront of defending personal privacy and human dignity.</li></ul><ul><li>As the nation that developed the Internet, the world expects us to ensure that the digital revolution works as a tool for individual empowerment, not government control. Having faced down the dangers of totalitarianism and fascism and communism, the world expects us to stand up for the principle that <b>every person has the right to think and write and form relationships freely -- because individual freedom is the wellspring of human progress.</b></li></ul><ul><li>Those values make us who we are. And because of the strength of our own democracy, we should not shy away from high expectations. For more than two centuries, our Constitution has weathered every type of change because we have been willing to defend it, and because we have been willing to question the actions that have been taken in its defense. Today is no different. I believe we can meet high expectations. <b>Together, let us chart a way forward that secures the life of our nation while preserving the liberties that make our nation worth fighting for.</b></li></ul><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Sixth_State_of_the_Union_Address_.28January_2014.29">Sixth State of the Union Address (January 2014)</span></h4><div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:222px;"><a href="/wiki/File:Countyelection.jpg" class="image"><img alt="" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Countyelection.jpg/220px-Countyelection.jpg" width="220" height="157" class="thumbimage" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Countyelection.jpg/330px-Countyelection.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4f/Countyelection.jpg/440px-Countyelection.jpg 2x" data-file-width="1024" data-file-height="730" /></a><div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/wiki/File:Countyelection.jpg" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div>Citizenship means standing up for everyone's right to vote.[...] It should be the power of our vote, not the size of our bank account, that drives our democracy.</div></div></div><div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:222px;"><a href="/wiki/File:Diagram_of_the_Federal_Government_and_American_Union_edit.jpg" class="image"><img alt="" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Diagram_of_the_Federal_Government_and_American_Union_edit.jpg/220px-Diagram_of_the_Federal_Government_and_American_Union_edit.jpg" width="220" height="171" class="thumbimage" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Diagram_of_the_Federal_Government_and_American_Union_edit.jpg/330px-Diagram_of_the_Federal_Government_and_American_Union_edit.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/00/Diagram_of_the_Federal_Government_and_American_Union_edit.jpg/440px-Diagram_of_the_Federal_Government_and_American_Union_edit.jpg 2x" data-file-width="4698" data-file-height="3660" /></a><div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/wiki/File:Diagram_of_the_Federal_Government_and_American_Union_edit.jpg" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div>Citizenship demands a sense of common purpose; participation in the hard work of self-government; an obligation to serve to our communities.</div></div></div><div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:222px;"><a href="/wiki/File:Thomas_P._Rossiter,_Signing_of_the_Constitution.jpg" class="image"><img alt="" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Thomas_P._Rossiter%2C_Signing_of_the_Constitution.jpg/220px-Thomas_P._Rossiter%2C_Signing_of_the_Constitution.jpg" width="220" height="104" class="thumbimage" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Thomas_P._Rossiter%2C_Signing_of_the_Constitution.jpg/330px-Thomas_P._Rossiter%2C_Signing_of_the_Constitution.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Thomas_P._Rossiter%2C_Signing_of_the_Constitution.jpg/440px-Thomas_P._Rossiter%2C_Signing_of_the_Constitution.jpg 2x" data-file-width="650" data-file-height="307" /></a><div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/wiki/File:Thomas_P._Rossiter,_Signing_of_the_Constitution.jpg" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div>We counter terrorism not just through intelligence and military action but by remaining true to our constitutional ideals and setting an example for the rest of the world.</div></div></div><div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:222px;"><a href="/wiki/File:Scene_at_the_Signing_of_the_Constitution_of_the_United_States.jpg" class="image"><img alt="" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Scene_at_the_Signing_of_the_Constitution_of_the_United_States.jpg/220px-Scene_at_the_Signing_of_the_Constitution_of_the_United_States.jpg" width="220" height="142" class="thumbimage" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Scene_at_the_Signing_of_the_Constitution_of_the_United_States.jpg/330px-Scene_at_the_Signing_of_the_Constitution_of_the_United_States.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Scene_at_the_Signing_of_the_Constitution_of_the_United_States.jpg/440px-Scene_at_the_Signing_of_the_Constitution_of_the_United_States.jpg 2x" data-file-width="3000" data-file-height="1933" /></a><div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/wiki/File:Scene_at_the_Signing_of_the_Constitution_of_the_United_States.jpg" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div>America has never come easy.

After all, that -- <b>that's the spirit that has always moved this nation forward.

And it was here in Europe, through centuries of struggle -- through war and <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Age_of_Enlightenment" class="extiw" title="w:Age of Enlightenment">Enlightenment</a>, repression and revolution -- that <b>a particular set of ideals began to emerge</b>: The belief that <b>through conscience and free will, each of us has the right to live as we choose.</b> The belief that <b>power is derived from the consent of the governed</b>, and that <b>laws and institutions should be established to protect that understanding.</b> And those ideas eventually inspired a band of colonialists across an ocean, and they wrote them into the founding documents that still guide America today, including the simple truth that <b>all men -- and women -- are created equal.</b> But those ideals have also been tested -- here in Europe and around the world. Those ideals have often been threatened by an older, more traditional view of power. This alternative vision argues that ordinary men and women are too small-minded to govern their own affairs, that order and progress can only come when individuals surrender their rights to an all-powerful sovereign. Often, this alternative vision roots itself in the notion that by virtue of race or faith or ethnicity, some are inherently superior to others, and that individual identity must be defined by “us” versus “them,” or that national greatness must flow not by what a people stand for, but by what they are against. In many ways, the history of Europe in the 20th century represented the ongoing clash of these two sets of ideas, both within nations and among nations. The advance of industry and technology outpaced our ability to resolve our differences peacefully, and even among the most civilized of societies, on the surface we saw a descent into barbarism.</li></ul><ul><li>This morning at <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flanders_Field_American_Cemetery_and_Memorial" class="extiw" title="w:Flanders Field American Cemetery and Memorial">Flanders Field</a>, I was reminded of how war between peoples sent a generation to their deaths in the trenches and gas of the <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">First World War</a>. And just two decades later, extreme nationalism plunged this continent into <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">war</a> once again -- with populations enslaved, and great cities reduced to rubble, and tens of millions slaughtered, including those lost in the <a href="/wiki/Holocaust" title="Holocaust">Holocaust</a>. It is in response to this tragic history that, in the aftermath of World War II, America joined with Europe to reject the darker forces of the past and build a new architecture of peace.

The people of Europe, hundreds of millions of citizens -- east, west, north, south -- are more secure and more prosperous because we stood together for the ideals we share. And this story of human progress was by no means limited to Europe. Indeed, the ideals that came to define our alliance also inspired movements across the globe among those very people, ironically, who had too often been denied their full rights by Western powers. After the Second World War, people from Africa to India threw off the yoke of colonialism to secure their independence. <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Rights_Movement" class="extiw" title="w:American Civil Rights Movement">In the United States, citizens took freedom rides and endured beatings to put an end to segregation and to secure their civil rights</a>.

Latin American nations rejected dictatorship and built new democracies, and Asian nations showed that development and democracy could go hand in hand.</li></ul><ul><li>Young people in the audience today, young people like Laura, were born in a place and a time where there is less conflict, more prosperity and more freedom than any time in human history. But that’s not because man’s darkest impulses have vanished. Even here, in Europe, we’ve seen <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balkan_Wars" class="extiw" title="w:Balkan Wars">ethnic cleansing in the Balkans</a> that shocked the conscience. The difficulties of integration and globalization, recently amplified by the worst economic crisis of our lifetimes, strained the European project and stirred the rise of a politics that too often targets immigrants or gays or those who seem somehow different. While technology has opened up vast opportunities for trade and innovation and cultural understanding, it’s also allowed terrorists to kill on a horrifying scale. Around the world, sectarian warfare and ethnic conflicts continue to claim thousands of lives. And <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Crimean_crisis" class="extiw" title="w:2014 Crimean crisis">once again, we are confronted with the belief among some that bigger nations can bully smaller ones to get their way</a> -- that recycled maxim that <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Might_makes_right" class="extiw" title="w:Might makes right">might somehow makes right</a>. So I come here today to insist that <b>we must never take for granted the progress that has been won here in Europe and advanced around the world, because the contest of ideas continues for your generation.</b> And <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Ukrainian_revolution" class="extiw" title="w:2014 Ukrainian revolution">that’s what’s at stake in Ukraine today</a>. Russia’s leadership is challenging truths that only a few weeks ago seemed self-evident -- that in the 21st century, the borders of Europe cannot be redrawn with force, that international law matters, that people and nations can make their own decisions about their future.</li></ul><ul><li>None of us can know for certain what the coming days will bring in Ukraine, but I am confident that eventually <b>those voices -- those voices for human dignity and opportunity and individual rights and rule of law -- those voices ultimately will triumph. I believe that over the long haul, as nations that are free, as free people, the future is ours.</b> I believe this not because I’m naïve, and I believe this not because of the strength of our arms or the size of our economies, <b>I believe this because these ideals that we affirm are true; these ideals are universal.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>Yes, we believe in democracy -- with elections that are free and fair; and independent judiciaries and opposition parties; civil society and uncensored information so that individuals can make their own choices. Yes, we believe in open economies based on free markets and innovation, and individual initiative and entrepreneurship, and trade and investment that creates a broader prosperity. And, yes, we believe in human dignity -- that every person is created equal, no matter who you are, or what you look like, or who you love, or where you come from. That is what we believe. That’s what makes us strong. And our enduring strength is also reflected in our respect for an international system that protects the rights of both nations and people -- a <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> and a <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Declaration_of_Human_Rights" class="extiw" title="w:Universal Declaration of Human Rights">Universal Declaration of Human Rights</a>; international law and the means to enforce those laws. But we also know that those rules are not self-executing; they depend on people and nations of goodwill continually affirming them.</b></li></ul><ul><li>Of course, neither the United States nor Europe are perfect in adherence to our ideals, nor do we claim to be the sole arbiter of what is right or wrong in the world. <b>We are human, after all, and we face difficult choices about how to exercise our power. But part of what makes us different is that we welcome criticism, just as we welcome the responsibilities that come with global leadership.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>No amount of propaganda can make right something that the world knows is wrong.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>There will always be voices who say that what happens in the wider world is not our concern, nor our responsibility. But we must never forget that we are heirs to a struggle for freedom. Our democracy, our individual opportunity only exists because those who came before us had the wisdom and the courage to recognize that our ideals will only endure if we see our self-interest in the success of other peoples and other nations.</b></li></ul><ul><li>And <b>it is you, the young people</b> of Europe, young people like Laura, <b>who will help decide which way the currents of our history will flow. Do not think for a moment that your own freedom, your own prosperity, that your own moral imagination is bound by the limits of your community, your ethnicity, or even your country. You’re bigger than that. You can help us to choose a better history.</b> That’s what Europe tells us. That’s what the American experience is all about.</li></ul><ul><li><b>In the end, the success of our ideals comes down to us -- including the example of our own lives, our own societies. We know that there will always be intolerance. But instead of fearing the immigrant, we can welcome him. We can insist on policies that benefit the many, not just the few; that an age of globalization and dizzying change opens the door of opportunity to the marginalized, and not just a privileged few. Instead of targeting our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters, we can use our laws to protect their rights. Instead of defining ourselves in opposition to others, we can affirm the aspirations that we hold in common.</b> That’s what will make America strong. That’s what will make Europe strong. <b>That’s what makes us who we are. And just as we meet our responsibilities as individuals, we must be prepared to meet them as nations. Because we live in a world in which our ideals are going to be challenged again and again by forces that would drag us back into conflict or corruption. We can’t count on others to rise to meet those tests.</b></li></ul><ul><li>And <b>that’s the question we all must answer</b> -- what kind of Europe, what kind of America, <b>what kind of world will we leave behind. And I believe that if we hold firm to our principles, and are willing to back our beliefs with courage and resolve, then hope will ultimately overcome fear, and freedom will continue to triumph over tyranny -- because that is what forever stirs in the human heart.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>It’s not a sign of strength. Anybody can make threats. Anyone can move an army. Anyone can show off a missile. That doesn’t make you strong. It does not lead to security, or opportunity, or respect. Those things don't come through force. They have to be earned.</b> And <b>real strength is allowing an open and participatory democracy, where people can choose their own leaders and choose their own destiny.</b> And <b>real strength is allowing a vibrant society, where people can think and pray and speak their minds as they please, even if it’s against their leaders -- especially if it’s against their leaders. Real strength is allowing free and open markets that have built growing, thriving middle classes and lifted millions of people out of poverty.</b></li></ul><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Young_Southeast_Asian_Leaders_Initiative_Town_Hall_.28April_2014.29">Young Southeast Asian Leaders Initiative Town Hall (April 2014)</span></h4><div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:222px;"><a href="/wiki/File:As08-16-2593.jpg" class="image"><img alt="" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/As08-16-2593.jpg/220px-As08-16-2593.jpg" width="220" height="194" class="thumbimage" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/As08-16-2593.jpg/330px-As08-16-2593.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1f/As08-16-2593.jpg/440px-As08-16-2593.jpg 2x" data-file-width="2015" data-file-height="1781" /></a><div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/wiki/File:As08-16-2593.jpg" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div>The most important thing for -- and maybe the most important thing for all the young people here -- is to realize that you really can have an impact on the world; you can achieve your dreams.

That diversity creates a unique intersection of humanity -- people from so many ethnic groups and backgrounds and religious and political beliefs. I gives Malaysia, as one primary example, the chance to prove -- as America constantly tries to prove -- that <b>nations are stronger and more successful when they work to uphold the civil rights and political rights and human rights of all their citizens.</b></li></ul><ul><li>Partnerships like those remind us that <b>the relationship between nations is not just defined by governments, but is defined by people -- especially the young people who will determine the future long after those of us who are currently in positions of power leave the stage.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>No nation is immune to dangerous and disruptive weather patterns, so every nation is going to have to do its part.</b> And the United States is ready to do ours. Last year, I introduced America’s first-ever Climate Action Plan to use more clean energy and less dirty energy, and cut the dangerous carbon pollution that contributes to climate change. So we want to cooperate with countries in Southeast Asia to do the same, to combat the destruction of our forests. <b>We can’t condemn future generations to a planet that is beyond fixing. We can only do that together.</b></li></ul><ul><li>America is the world’s oldest constitutional <b>democracy</b>; that means we’re going to stand up for democracy -- it’s a part of who we are. And we do this not only because we think it’s right, but because <b>it’s been proven to be the most stable and successful form of government.</b> In recent decades, many Asian nations have shown that different nations can realize the promise of self-government in their own way; they have their own path. But <b>we must recognize that democracies don’t stop just with elections; they also depend on strong institutions and a vibrant civil society, and open political space, and tolerance of people who are different than you. We have to create an environment where the rights of every citizen, regardless of race or gender, or religion or sexual orientation are not only protected, but respected.</b></li></ul><ul><li>We know that <b>progress can always be reversed</b>, and that <b>positive change is achieved not through passion alone, but through patient and persistent effort.</b> But we’ve seen things change for the better in this region and around the world <b>because of the effort of ordinary people, together -- working together.</b></li></ul><ul><li>And when I think back to my journey, my past, I think <b>the most important thing for -- and maybe the most important thing for all the young people here -- is to realize that you really can have an impact on the world; you can achieve your dreams. But in order to do so, you have to focus not so much on a title or how much money you’re going to make, you have to focus more on what kind of influence and impact are you going to have on other people’s lives -- what good can you do in the world.</b> Now, that may involve starting a business, but if you want to start a business you should be really excited about the product or the service that you’re making. It shouldn’t just be how much money I can make -- because the business people who I meet who do amazing things, like <a href="/wiki/Bill_Gates" title="Bill Gates">Bill Gates</a>, who started Microsoft -- they’re usually people who are really interested in what they do and they really think that it can make a difference in people’s lives. <b>If you want to go into government, you shouldn’t just want to be a particular government official. You should want to go into government because you think it can help educate some children, or it can help provide jobs for people who need work.</b> So I think <b>the most important thing for me was when I started thinking more about other people and how I could have an impact in my larger society and community, and wasn’t just thinking about myself. That’s when I think your dreams can really take off -- because if you’re only thinking about you, then your world is small; if you‘re thinking about others, then your world gets bigger.</b></li></ul><ul><li>The world has gotten smaller and <b>no country is going to succeed if part of its population is put on the sidelines because they’re discriminated against. [...] No society is going to succeed if half your population -- meaning women -- aren’t getting the same education and employment opportunities as men.</b> So I think the key point for all of you, especially as young people, is <b>you should embrace your culture. You should be proud of who you are and your background. And you should appreciate the differences in language and food. And how you worship God is going to be different, and those are things that you should be proud of. But it shouldn’t be a tool to look down on somebody else. It shouldn’t be a reason to discriminate. And you have to make sure that you are speaking out against that in your daily life, and as you emerge as leaders you should be on the side of politics that brings people together rather than drives them apart. That is the most important thing for this generation.</b> And <b>part of the way to do that is to be able to stand in other people’s shoes, see through their eyes.</b> Almost every religion has within it the basic principle that I, as a Christian, understand from the teachings of <a href="/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus</a>. <b>Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. Treat people the way you want to be treated. And if you’re not doing that and if society is not respecting that basic principle, then we’re going backwards instead of going forward.</b> [...] And when you see astronauts from Japan or from the United States or from Russia or others working together, and they’re looking down at this planet from a distance you realize <b>we’re all on this little rock in the middle of space and the differences that seem so important to us from a distance dissolve into nothing. And so, we have to have that same perspective -- respecting everybody, treating everybody equally under the law. That has to be a principle that all of you uphold.</b></li></ul><ul><li>So, <b>first of all, you’ve got to try to get people involved.</b> And a lot of people are busy in their own lives or they don’t think it’s going to make a difference or they’re scared if they’re speaking out against authority. And many of the problems that we’re facing, like trying to create jobs or better opportunity or dealing with poverty or dealing with the environment, these are problems that have been going on for decades. And so, <b>to think that somehow you’re going to change it in a day or a week, and then if it doesn’t happen you just give up, well, then you definitely won’t succeed. So the most important thing that I learned as a young person trying to bring about change is you have to be persistent, and you have to get more people involved, and you have to form relationships with different groups and different organizations. And you have to listen to people about what they’re feeling and what they’re concerned about, and build trust. And then, you have to try to find a small part of the problem and get success on that first, so that maybe from there you can start something else and make it bigger and make it bigger, until over time you are really making a difference in your community and in that problem. But you can’t be impatient.</b> And the great thing about young people is they’re impatient. The biggest problem with young people is they’re impatient. It’s a strength, because it’s what makes you want to change things. But sometimes, <b>you can be disappointed if change doesn’t happen right away and then you just give up. And you just have to stay with it and learn from your failures, as well as your successes.</b></li></ul><ul><li>But what you’ve also seen is a trend in the United States but also around the world in which even when the economy grows, it tends to benefit a lot of people at the very top, but the vast majority of people, they don't benefit as much. And you're starting to see bigger and bigger gaps in inequality and in wealth and in opportunity. And that's true not just in the United States, it's true in Europe; it's long been true in parts of Asia; it's been true in Latin America. And I believe that <b>economies work best when growth and development is broad-based, when it's shared -- when ordinary people, if they work hard and they take responsibility, they can succeed. Not everybody is going to be rich, but everybody should be able to live a good life. Not everybody is going to be a billionaire, but everybody should be able to have a nice home and educate their children and feel some sense of security.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>Investing in people is the single most important thing in the knowledge economy. Traditionally, wealth was defined by land and natural resources. Today the most important resources is between our ears.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>Treat people with respect, whoever they are, and expect your governments to treat everybody with respect. And if you do that, then you’re going to be okay.</b></li></ul><ul><li>[...] despite how hard sometimes the world seems to be, and all you see on television is war and conflict and poverty and violence, <b>the truth is that if you had to choose when to be born, not knowing where or who you would be, in all of human history, now would be the time. Because the world is less violent, it is healthier, it is wealthier, it is more tolerant and it offers more opportunity than any time in human history for more people than any time in human history.</b> Now, that doesn’t mean that there aren’t still terrible things happening around the world or in this region. We still have things like human trafficking. And we still have terrible abuse of children. And there are conflicts. And so <b>these are things that we’re going to have to tackle and deal with. But you should know that with each successive generation things have improved just a little bit. And over time, that little bit adds to a lot. And it’s now up to you, the next generation, to make sure that 20 years from now, or 30 years from now, people look back and say, wow, things are a lot better now than they were back then. And there will still be problems 20 or 30 years from now also.

And in that age-old contest of ideas -- between freedom and authoritarianism, between liberty and oppression, between solidarity and intolerance -- Poland’s progress shows the enduring strength of the ideals that we cherish as a free people. Here we see the strength of democracy: Citizens raising their voices, free from fear. Here we see political parties competing in open and honest elections. Here we see an independent judiciary working to uphold the rule of law. Here in Poland we see a vibrant press and a growing civil society that holds leaders accountable -- because <b>governments exist to lift up their people, not to hold them down.</b></li></ul><ul><li>Poland understands as few other nations do that <b>every nation must be free to chart its own course, to forge its own partnerships, to choose its own allies.</b></li></ul><ul><li>It’s a wonderful story, but the story of this nation reminds us that <b>freedom is not guaranteed.

We’re not afraid of an independent judiciary, because no one is above the law. We’re not afraid of a free press or vibrant debate or a strong civil society, because leaders must be held accountable. We’re not afraid to let our young people go online to learn and discover and organize, because we know that countries are more successful when citizens are free to think for themselves.</b></li></ul><ul><li>Because of the work of generations, because we’ve stood together in a great alliance, because people across this continent have forged a European Union dedicated to cooperation and peace, we have made historic progress toward the vision we share -- a Europe that is whole and free and at peace. And yet, as we gather here today, we know that this vision is threatened by <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2014_Russian_military_intervention_in_Ukraine" class="extiw" title="w:2014 Russian military intervention in Ukraine">Russia’s aggression against Ukraine</a>. It is a brazen assault on the territorial integrity of Ukraine -- a sovereign and independent European nation. It challenges that <b>most basic of principles of our international system</b> -- that <b><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annexation_of_Crimea_by_the_Russian_Federation" class="extiw" title="w:Annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation">borders cannot be redrawn at the barrel of a gun</a></b>; that <b>nations have the right to determine their own future</b>. It undermines <b>an international order where the rights of peoples and nations are upheld and can’t simply be taken away by brute force.</b></li></ul><ul><li>And even as we meet conventional threats, <b>we need to face other challenges. And that includes propaganda campaigns that try to whip up fears and divide people from one another. We reject the idea that people cannot live and thrive together, just because they have different backgrounds or speak a different language. And the best antidotes to such distorted thinking are the values that define us.</b> Not just in the Baltics, but throughout Europe, <b>we must acknowledge the inherent dignity and human rights of every person -- because our democracies cannot truly succeed until we root out bias and prejudice, both from our institutions and from our hearts. We have to uphold a free press and freedom of speech -- because, in the end, lies and misinformation are no match for the truth. We have to embrace open and inclusive societies -- because our countries are more successful and more prosperous when we welcome the talents of all our people, including minorities.</b> That’s part of the work that we must do. That's the example we must set.</li></ul><ul><li>And this brings me to the final area where our nations have to come together -- in our steadfast support for those who reach for their freedom. And, yes, that includes the people of Ukraine. And few understand this better than the Baltic peoples. You know from bitter experience that <b>we can never take our security and liberties for granted.</b> We want Ukrainians to be independent and strong and able to make their own choices free from fear and intimidation, because <b>the more countries are free and strong, and free from intimidation, the more secure our own liberties are.</b></li></ul><ul><li>In the face of violence that seems intractable and suffering that is so senseless, it is easy to grow cynical, and I think tempting to give in to the notion that peace and security may be beyond our grasp. But I say to all of you here today, especially the young people, do not give into that cynicism. Do not lose the idealism and optimism that is the root of all great change. Don’t ever lose the faith that says, if we want it, if we are willing to work for it, if we stand together, the future can be different; tomorrow can be better.</li></ul><ul><li><b>Yes, there will be setbacks and there will be frustrations, and there will be moments of doubt and moments of despair. The currents of history ebb and flow, but over time they flow toward freedom -- more people, in every corner of the Earth, standing up and reaching to claim those rights that are universal. And that’s why, in the end, our ideals are stronger. And that’s why, in the end, our ideals will win.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b><a href="/wiki/Dignity" title="Dignity">Dignity</a> will win -- because every human being is born equal, with free will and inalienable rights.

It will not involve American combat troops fighting on foreign soil. <b>This counterterrorism campaign will be waged through a steady, relentless effort to take out ISIL wherever they exist, using our air power and our support for partner forces on the ground. This strategy of taking out terrorists who threaten us, while supporting partners on the front lines, is one that we have successfully pursued in Yemen and Somalia for years. And it is consistent with the approach I outlined earlier this year</b>: <b>to use force against anyone who threatens America’s core interests, but to mobilize partners wherever possible to address broader challenges to international order.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>Despite all the divisions and discord within our democracy, I see the grit and determination and common goodness of the American people every single day –- and that makes me more confident than ever about our country’s future.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>America, our endless blessings bestow an enduring burden. But as Americans, we welcome our responsibility to lead.</b> From Europe to Asia, from the far reaches of Africa to war-torn capitals of the Middle East, <b>we stand for freedom, for justice, for dignity. These are values that have guided our nation since its founding. Tonight, I ask for your support in carrying that leadership forward.</b> I do so as a Commander-in-Chief who could not be prouder of our men and women in uniform –- pilots who bravely fly in the face of danger above the Middle East, and servicemembers who support our partners on the ground. [...] And <b>our own safety, our own security, depends upon our willingness to do what it takes to defend this nation and uphold the values that we stand for –- timeless ideals that will endure long after those who offer only hate and destruction have been vanquished from the Earth.</b></li></ul><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Remarks_at_Clinton_Global_Initiative_.28September_2014.29">Remarks at Clinton Global Initiative (September 2014)</span></h4><div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:222px;"><a href="/wiki/File:D-Day_70_COLLEVILLE-SUR-MER.jpg" class="image"><img alt="" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/D-Day_70_COLLEVILLE-SUR-MER.jpg/220px-D-Day_70_COLLEVILLE-SUR-MER.jpg" width="220" height="151" class="thumbimage" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/D-Day_70_COLLEVILLE-SUR-MER.jpg/330px-D-Day_70_COLLEVILLE-SUR-MER.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7f/D-Day_70_COLLEVILLE-SUR-MER.jpg/440px-D-Day_70_COLLEVILLE-SUR-MER.jpg 2x" data-file-width="2187" data-file-height="1506" /></a><div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/wiki/File:D-Day_70_COLLEVILLE-SUR-MER.jpg" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div>The most important title is citizen.

But as leaders, we are not the most important people here today. It is the civil society leaders who, in many ways, are going to have the more lasting impact, because as the saying goes, <b>the most important title is not president or prime minister; the most important title is citizen. It is citizens -- ordinary men and women, determined to forge their own future -- who throughout history have sparked all the great change and progress.</b></li></ul><ul><li>These <b>citizens remind us why civil society is so essential. When people are free to speak their minds and hold their leaders accountable, governments are more responsive and more effective. When entrepreneurs are free to create and develop new ideas, then economies are more innovative, and attract more trade and investment, and ultimately become more prosperous. When communities, including minorities, are free to live and pray and love as they choose; when nations uphold the rights of all their people -— including, perhaps especially, women and girls -— then those countries are more likely to thrive. If you want strong, successful countries, you need strong, vibrant civil societies. When citizens are free to organize and work together across borders to make our communities healthier, our environment cleaner, and our world safer, that's when real change comes.</b></li></ul><h4><span class="mw-headline" id="Address_to_the_United_Nations_.28September_2014.29">Address to the United Nations (September 2014)</span></h4><div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:222px;"><a href="/wiki/File:Chinadialogue_speaking_CK-0038.jpg" class="image"><img alt="" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Chinadialogue_speaking_CK-0038.jpg/220px-Chinadialogue_speaking_CK-0038.jpg" width="220" height="147" class="thumbimage" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Chinadialogue_speaking_CK-0038.jpg/330px-Chinadialogue_speaking_CK-0038.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d9/Chinadialogue_speaking_CK-0038.jpg/440px-Chinadialogue_speaking_CK-0038.jpg 2x" data-file-width="525" data-file-height="350" /></a><div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/wiki/File:Chinadialogue_speaking_CK-0038.jpg" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div>No external power can bring about a transformation of hearts and minds.</div></div></div><div class="thumb tright"><div class="thumbinner" style="width:222px;"><a href="/wiki/File:United_Nations_Building_3.jpg" class="image"><img alt="" src="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/United_Nations_Building_3.jpg/220px-United_Nations_Building_3.jpg" width="220" height="293" class="thumbimage" srcset="//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/United_Nations_Building_3.jpg/330px-United_Nations_Building_3.jpg 1.5x, //upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/0d/United_Nations_Building_3.jpg/440px-United_Nations_Building_3.jpg 2x" data-file-width="1536" data-file-height="2048" /></a><div class="thumbcaption"><div class="magnify"><a href="/wiki/File:United_Nations_Building_3.jpg" class="internal" title="Enlarge"></a></div>Peace is not merely the absence of war, but the presence of a better life.</div></div></div><dl><dd><small><a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2014/09/24/remarks-president-obama-address-united-nations-general-assembly">Remarks by President Obama in Address to the United Nations General Assembly on September 24, 2014 in the United Nations General Assembly Hall, New York City, New York, USA.</a></small></dd></dl><ul><li><b>We choose hope over fear. We see the future not as something out of our control, but as something we can shape for the better through concerted and collective effort. We reject fatalism or cynicism when it comes to human affairs. We choose to work for the world as it should be, as our children deserve it to be.</b></li></ul><ul><li>And we call upon others to join us on the right side of history -- for <b>while small gains can be won at the barrel of a gun, they will ultimately be turned back if enough voices support the freedom of nations and peoples to make their own decisions.</b></li></ul><ul><li><b>If the world acts together, we can make sure that all of our children enjoy lives of opportunity and dignity.</b></li></ul><ul><li>I have made it clear that America will not base our entire foreign policy on reacting to terrorism. Instead, <b>we’ve waged a focused campaign against <a href="/wiki/Al_Qaeda" title="Al Qaeda" class="mw-redirect">al Qaeda</a> and its associated forces — taking out their leaders, denying them the safe havens they rely on.</b> At the same time, <b>we have reaffirmed again and again that the United States is not and never will be at war with <a href="/wiki/Islam" title="Islam">Islam</a>. Islam teaches <a href="/wiki/Peace" title="Peace">peace</a>.</b> Muslims the world over aspire to live with dignity and a sense of justice. And when it comes to America and Islam, there is no us and them, there is only us — because millions of Muslim Americans are part of the fabric of our country.<br />So we reject any suggestion of a clash of civilizations. <b>Belief in permanent religious war is the misguided refuge of extremists who cannot build or create anything, and therefore peddle only <a href="/wiki/Fanaticism" title="Fanaticism">fanaticism</a> and <a href="/wiki/Hate" title="Hate" class="mw-redirect">hate</a>.</b> And it is no exaggeration to say that humanity’s future depends on us uniting against those who would divide us along the fault lines of tribe or sect, race or religion.</li></ul><ul><li>Those who continue to fight for a hateful cause will find they are increasingly alone. For we will not succumb to threats, and we will demonstrate that <b>the <a href="/wiki/Future" title="Future">future</a> belongs to those who build — not those who destroy.</b></li></ul><ul><li>You have demonstrated that <b>when young people have the tools to succeed -- good schools, education in math and science, an economy that nurtures creativity and entrepreneurship -- then societies will flourish.[...] Where women are full participants in a country’s politics or economy, societies are more likely to succeed. [...] If young people live in places where the only option is between the dictates of a state, or the lure of an extremist underground, then no counterterrorism strategy can succeed. But where a genuine civil society is allowed to flourish -- where people can express their views, and organize peacefully for a better life -- then you dramatically expand the alternatives to terror.</b></li></ul><ul><li>Now, ultimately, <b>the task of rejecting sectarianism and rejecting extremism is a generational task</b> -- and a task for the people of the Middle East themselves. <b>No external power can bring about a transformation of hearts and minds.</b> But America will be a respectful and constructive partner. We will neither tolerate terrorist safe havens, nor act as an occupying power. We will take action against threats to our security and our allies, while building an architecture of counterterrorism cooperation. We will increase efforts to lift up those who counter extremist ideologies and who seek to resolve sectarian conflict. And we will expand our <b>programs to support entrepreneurship and civil society, education and youth -- because, ultimately, these investments are the best antidote to violence.</b></li></ul><ul><li>So this is what America is prepared to do: Taking action against immediate threats, while pursuing a world in which the need for such action is diminished. The United States will never shy away from defending our interests, but we will also not shy away from the promise of this institution and its Universal Declaration of Human Rights -- the notion that <b>peace is not merely the absence of war, but the presence of a better life.</b></li></ul><p><br /></p><div style="padding: .5em; border: 1px solid black; background-color: #FFE7CC;"><h2><span class="mw-headline" id="Misattributed">Misattributed</span></h2><ul><li>We are no longer a Christian nation; we are now a nation of Christians, Jews, Muslims, Buddhists.<ul><li>Misquoted in similar letters to the editor to the <i>San Angelo Standard-Times</i>, <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="2008-07-29">2008-07-29</span> and the <i>Inland Valley Daily Bulletin</i>, <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="2008-07-29">2008-07-29</span>, and many identical posts under different names to various online news sites, quoted in <cite style="font-style:normal" class="">"<a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.factcheck.org/2008/08/obama-and-the-christian-nation-quote/">Obama and the “Christian Nation” Quote</a>", <i>Factcheck.org</i>, 26 August 2008</cite><span class="Z3988" title="ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=info%3Aofi%2Ffmt%3Akev%3Amtx%3Ajournal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Obama+and+the+%E2%80%9CChristian+Nation%E2%80%9D+Quote&amp;rft.jtitle=Factcheck.org&amp;rft.date=26+August+2008&amp;rft_id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.factcheck.org%2F2008%2F08%2Fobama-and-the-christian-nation-quote%2F&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/en.wikipedia.org:Barack_Obama"><span style="display: none;">&#160;</span></span></li><li>President Obama actually said, in his keynote address to <i>Sojourners</i> magazine's "Call to Renewal" conference on <span class="mw-formatted-date" title="2006-06-28">2006-06-28</span> (see above), "Whatever we once were, we are no longer a Christian nation — at least, not <i>just</i>.

Kennedy">John F. Kennedy</a>. But his recent maneuvers increasingly suggest that they selected another <a href="/wiki/Dwight_Eisenhower" title="Dwight Eisenhower" class="mw-redirect">Dwight Eisenhower</a>.<br />That’s not a comment on President Obama’s effectiveness or ideology, but rather on his conception of presidential leadership. Whether he is confronting the turmoil reshaping the Middle East or the escalating budget wars in Washington, Obama most often uses a common set of strategies to pursue his goals. Those strategies have less in common with Kennedy’s inspirational, public-oriented leadership than with the muted, indirect, and targeted Eisenhower model that political scientist <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.princeton.edu/~fig/">Fred Greenstein</a> memorably described as a “hidden hand” presidency.<br />This approach has allowed Obama to achieve many of his domestic and international aims — from passing the health reform legislation that marked its stormy first anniversary this week to encouraging Egypt’s peaceful transfer of power. But, like it did for Eisenhower, this style has exposed Obama to charges of passivity, indecisiveness, and leading from behind. The pattern has left even some of his supporters uncertain whether he is shrewd — or timid.<br />On most issues, Obama has consciously chosen not to make himself the fulcrum. He has identified broad goals but has generally allowed others to take the public lead, waited until the debate has substantially coalesced, and only then announced a clear, visible stand meant to solidify consensus. He appears to believe he can most often exert maximum leverage toward the end of any process — an implicit rejection of the belief that a president’s greatest asset is his ability to define the choices for the country (and the world).<br />To the extent that Obama shapes processes along the way, he tends to do so offstage rather than in public. Throughout, he has shown an unswerving resistance to absolutist public pronouncements and grand theories.<ul><li>Ronald Brownstein, in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.nationaljournal.com/columns/political-connections/obama-a-lot-like-ike-20110324">"Like Ike" in <i>NationaJournal</i> (25 March 2011)</a>.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>President Obama is so much smarter and a better communicator than members of Congress in either party.

Obama cited those words in his own inaugural proclamation and rested his hand on Lincoln’s Bible when he took the oath of office. He has come back to those angels again and again ever since. … He used the phrase to eulogize <a href="/wiki/Ted_Kennedy" title="Ted Kennedy">Ted Kennedy</a>, to chide a would-be Quran burner in Florida, and to say goodbye to chief of staff <a href="/wiki/Rahm_Emanuel" title="Rahm Emanuel">Rahm Emanuel</a>.

Even as he traveled in India this week he talked about his efforts to live up to the example of <a href="/wiki/Mahatma_Gandhi" title="Mahatma Gandhi">Mahatma Gandhi</a>, <a href="/wiki/Martin_Luther_King_Jr." title="Martin Luther King Jr." class="mw-redirect">Martin Luther King Jr.</a>, and, yes, Abraham Lincoln.<br />But in light of today's real-world politics, Obama should think a little harder about the context in which Lincoln summoned those better angels on March 4, 1861. Led by South Carolina (now home to Sen. <a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_DeMint" class="extiw" title="w:Jim DeMint">Jim DeMint</a>, seven of 33 states had already seceded from the Union to form the Confederacy at that point. …&#160;If, in the end, Lincoln did manage to hold the Union together, it was not because of the better angels of human nature, but because he finally found the killer angels among his generals who could, and did, and at enormous cost, crush the secessionists.<ul><li><a href="//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Dickey" class="extiw" title="w:Christopher Dickey">Christopher Dickey</a>, in <a rel="nofollow" class="external text" href="http://www.newsweek.com/2010/11/10/better-angels-and-killer-angels.html">"Better Angels and Killer Angels" in <i>Newsweek</i> (10 November 2010)</a>.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>Lincoln had an ally then of a kind that Obama could use now.

In the months between the inauguration and Douglas’s early death in June 1861, the “little giant,” as he was known, spent many long hours talking to Lincoln about how best to preserve the Union—and compromise wasn’t part of the picture. … “You do not know the dishonest purposes of those men as I do,” he told Lincoln.<br />What both of those great politicians understood by then was that there may be better angels in the nature of some people, but there are others who are willing to weaken, even destroy a nation to serve their own self-righteous self-interest, and they will do it in the name of the Constitution.

Three years later, foreclosures are still at record levels. Three years later the prices of homes continue to fall.
