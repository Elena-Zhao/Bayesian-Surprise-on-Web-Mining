According to one of his wives, the British imprisoned and tortured      him for taking part in the Kenyan revolution after WWII. He converted from      Christianity to Islam. He was a prominent farmer, elder of the tribe, and      healer.<sup>b</sup></li><li>Obama has many, many relatives, as Obama&rsquo;s father, paternal grandfather,      and paternal great-grandfather each had several wives and many children.      His grandfather was known in the family as &ldquo;The Terror&rdquo; and      his father was called &ldquo;Old Man.&rdquo;<sup>f</sup></li><li>Barack Obama&rsquo;s father was born into Kenya&rsquo;s Luo tribe in the village      of Nyan&rsquo;oma Kogela near Lake Victoria. He was a remarkable student      but was kicked out of school for missing class and being disruptive. He      initially identified himself as a Muslim, but spent much of his adult life      as an atheist.<sup>g</sup></li><li>When Obama&rsquo;s father was accepted to the University of Hawaii with      full tuition at the age of 23, he left his pregnant first wife (Kezia)      and son in the care of his father&rsquo;s third wife Sarah Hussein Onyango      in Kenya.

The entire family moved to <a href="http://facts.randomhistory.com/2009/04/03_hawaii.html">Hawaii</a> in the next year, 1959--the      same year Barack Obama Sr. arrived.<sup>d</sup></li><li>Obama&rsquo;s father and mother met in a Russian class at the University      of Hawaii when she was 18 years old. Because she waited for him when he      was late for their first date, he declared that she was a &ldquo;good woman.&rdquo;<sup>a</sup></li><li>In 1961, Ann and Barack Obama Sr. wed in a small civil ceremony. Ann      was already three months pregnant with Barack at the time of the wedding      and was under the impression Obama Sr. was divorced from his first wife.      In 1961, interracial <a href="http://facts.randomhistory.com/interesting-facts-about-marriage.html">marriage</a> was still illegal in some states, but not      in Hawaii.<sup>a</sup></li><li>Barack Obama Sr.&rsquo;s father was outright opposed to his son&rsquo;s      marriage to Ann Durnham because he thought his son was neglecting his wife      and two children in Kenya.

In 1965, Obama Sr. completed  his master&rsquo;s degree and returned to Kenya with another woman, Ruth Nidesand,  a Caucasian American-born teacher.<sup>f</sup></li><li>In 1967, Barack Obama&rsquo;s mother married her second husband, Lolo      (&ldquo;Crazy&rdquo;) Soetoro from Indonesia. Lolo practiced a form of      Islam that incorporated ideas from other belief systems.<sup>g</sup></li><li>While living in Indonesia with his mother and &nbsp;Lolo, Obama played in  rice paddies, rode water buffalo, and ate chili peppers, dog meat, snake meat,  and roasted grasshopper. He had a pet ape called &ldquo;Tata,&rdquo; and baby  alligators, chickens, and ducks lived in the yard. For the first time, he also  encountered people who had leprosy and lived in extreme poverty.<sup>f</sup></li><li>Obama&rsquo;s schoolmates in Indonesia sometimes called him &ldquo;Curly      Eyelashes&rdquo; because his lashes were so long and curly.<sup>g</sup></li><li>In 1970, Obama&rsquo;s mother and Lolo had a daughter, Barack&rsquo;s half-sister      Maya Soetoro-Ng. In 1971, Ann sent Barack back to Hawaii after realizing      she did not want him to grow up in Indonesia. She later divorced Lolo.<sup>a</sup></li><li>With the help of Ann&rsquo;s parents, Obama received a scholarship to      Punahou, a prestigious prep school in Hawaii. He graduated in 1979 with      honors.<sup>d</sup></li><li>Obama&rsquo;s mother died in 1995 of ovarian and uterine cancer.

He also has worked in construction.<sup>e</sup></li><li>In 1985, Obama worked on the Developing Communities Project, a Chicago      group which tries to empower the poor through grass roots organization      and is based on the community organizing tradition of Marxist Saul Alinsky.      Alinsky was friends for a time with Al Capone, and his followers included      Cesar Chavez and several anti-Vietnam protesters.<sup>e</sup></li><li>Obama has been criticized for his supposed association with Bill Ayers,      who was part of the &ldquo;Weather Underground,&rdquo; an anti-Vietnam      organization that the FBI labeled &ldquo;a domestic terrorist group.&rdquo; Most likely casual at best, Obama and Ayers&rsquo; assocations include serving together on the board for the non-profit Woods Fund of Chicago from 1999 to 2002, and occasionally meeting as members of the non-profit Chicago Annenberg Challenge. Obama has denounced Ayers&rsquo; actions in the 60s and 70s.<sup>c</sup></li><li>While at Punahou Academy, Barack befriended Frank Marshall Davis (1905-1987),      a journalist, poet, and supposed communist whom he looked to as a role      model.<sup>e</sup></li><li>In high school, playing basketball offered him some companionship, though      he often felt he didn&rsquo;t completely belong with his peers.

He won a Grammy award for        the audio version of the book. His second book, <em>The Audacity of Hope:        Thoughts of Reclaiming the American Dream</em>, was endorsed by Oprah        Winfrey and became a best seller. Its title was derived from a sermon        by Obama&rsquo;s former pastor and controversial figure, Reverend Jeremiah        Wright.<sup>e</sup></li><li>Following 9/11, Obama was an early opponent of President George W.

She was his      mentor and was not initially attracted to him--but after a two-year courtship,      they were married in the fall of 1992 at the Trinity United Church of Christ.      Reverend Wright presided and would also later baptize their two daughters,      Malia Ann (born July 4,1998) and Natasha (&ldquo;Sasha&rdquo;) (June 10,      2001).<sup>e</sup></li><li>After Reverend Wright continued to make inflammatory remarks during Obama&rsquo;s      campaign, Obama denounced him and formally quit the congregation of the      Trinity United Church of Christ.<sup>e</sup></li><li>Obama&rsquo;s race against Alan Keyes in 2004 marked the first time in      U.S. history that two African-Americans ran as major party nominees for      a Senate seat.
