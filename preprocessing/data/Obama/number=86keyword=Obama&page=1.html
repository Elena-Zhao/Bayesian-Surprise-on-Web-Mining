Does    the president have inherent powers under the Constitution to    conduct surveillance for national security purposes without judicial    warrants, regardless of federal statutes?</FONT></P>    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">The Supreme    Court has never held that the president has such powers. As president,    I will follow existing law, and when it comes to U.S. citizens    and residents, I will only authorize surveillance for national    security purposes consistent with FISA and other federal statutes.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">2. In    what circumstances, if any, would the president have constitutional    authority to bomb Iran without seeking a use-of-force authorization    from Congress? (Specifically, what about the strategic bombing    of suspected nuclear sites -- a situation that does not involve    stopping an IMMINENT threat?)</FONT></P>    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">The President    does not have power under the Constitution to unilaterally authorize    a military attack in a situation that does not involve stopping    an actual or imminent threat to the nation.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">As Commander-in-Chief,    the President does have a duty to protect and defend the United    States. In instances of self-defense, the President would be    within his constitutional authority to act before advising Congress    or seeking its consent. History has shown us time and again,    however, that military action is most successful when it is authorized    and supported by the Legislative branch. It is always preferable    to have the informed consent of Congress prior to any military    action.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">3. Does    the Constitution empower the president to disregard a congressional    statute limiting the deployment of troops -- either by capping    the number of troops that may be deployed to a particular country    or by setting minimum home-stays between deployments? In other    words, is that level of deployment management beyond the constitutional    power of Congress to regulate?</FONT></P>    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">No, the    President does not have that power. To date, several Congresses    have imposed limitations on the number of US troops deployed    in a given situation. As President, I will not assert a constitutional    authority to deploy troops in a manner contrary to an express    limit imposed by Congress and adopted into law.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">4. Under    what circumstances, if any, would you sign a bill into law but    also issue a signing statement reserving a constitutional right    to bypass the law?</FONT></P>    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">Signing    statements have been used by presidents of both parties, dating    back to Andrew Jackson. While it is legitimate for a president    to issue a signing statement to clarify his understanding of    ambiguous provisions of statutes and to explain his view of how    he intends to faithfully execute the law, it is a clear abuse    of power to use such statements as a license to evade laws that    the president does not like or as an end-run around provisions    designed to foster accountability.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">I will    not use signing statements to nullify or undermine congressional    instructions as enacted into law. The problem with this administration    is that it has attached signing statements to legislation in    an effort to change the meaning of the legislation, to avoid    enforcing certain provisions of the legislation that the President    does not like, and to raise implausible or dubious constitutional    objections to the legislation. The fact that President Bush has    issued signing statements to challenge over 1100 laws &#150;    more than any president in history &#150; is a clear abuse of    this prerogative. No one doubts that it is appropriate to use    signing statements to protect a president's constitutional prerogatives;    unfortunately, the Bush Administration has gone much further    than that.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">5. Does    the Constitution permit a president to detain US citizens without    charges as unlawful enemy combatants?</FONT></P>    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">No. I    reject the Bush Administration's claim that the President has    plenary authority under the Constitution to detain U.S. citizens    without charges as unlawful enemy combatants.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">6. Does    executive privilege cover testimony or documents about decision-making    within the executive branch not involving confidential advice    communicated to the president himself?</FONT></P>    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">With respect    to the &#147;core&#148; of executive privilege, the Supreme Court    has not resolved this question, and reasonable people have debated    it. My view is that executive privilege generally depends on    the involvement of the President and the White House.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">7. If    Congress defines a specific interrogation technique as prohibited    under all circumstances, does the president's authority as commander    in chief ever permit him to instruct his subordinates to employ    that technique despite the statute?</FONT></P>    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">No. The    President is not above the law, and the Commander-in-Chief power    does not entitle him to use techniques that Congress has specifically    banned as torture. We must send a message to the world that America    is a nation of laws, and a nation that stands against torture.    As President I will abide by statutory prohibitions, and have    the Army Field Manual govern interrogation techniques for all    United States Government personnel and contractors.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">8. Under    what circumstances, if any, is the president, when operating    overseas as commander-in-chief, free to disregard international    human rights treaties that the US Senate has ratified?</FONT></P>    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">It is    illegal and unwise for the President to disregard international    human rights treaties that have been ratified by the United States    Senate, including and especially the Geneva Conventions. The    Commander-in-Chief power does not allow the President to defy    those treaties.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">9. Do    you agree or disagree with the statement made by former Attorney    General Gonzales in January 2007 that nothing in the Constitution    confers an affirmative right to habeas corpus, separate from    any statutory habeas rights Congress might grant or take away?</FONT></P>    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">Disagree    strongly.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">10. Is    there any executive power the Bush administration has claimed    or exercised that you think is unconstitutional? Anything you    think is simply a bad idea?</FONT></P>    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">First    and foremost, I agree with the Supreme Court's several decisions    rejecting the extreme arguments of the Bush Administration, most    importantly in the Hamdi and Hamdan cases. I also reject the    view, suggested in memoranda by the Department of Justice, that    the President may do whatever he deems necessary to protect national    security, and that he may torture people in defiance of congressional    enactments. In my view, torture is unconstitutional, and certain    enhanced interrogation techniques like &#147;waterboarding&#148;    clearly constitute torture. And as noted, I reject the use of    signing statements to make extreme and implausible claims of    presidential authority.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">Some further    points:</FONT></P>    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">The detention    of American citizens, without access to counsel, fair procedure,    or pursuant to judicial authorization, as enemy combatants is    unconstitutional.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">Warrantless    surveillance of American citizens, in defiance of FISA, is unlawful    and unconstitutional.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">The violation    of international treaties that have been ratified by the Senate,    specifically the Geneva Conventions, was illegal (as the Supreme    Court held) and a bad idea.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">The creation    of military commissions, without congressional authorization,    was unlawful (as the Supreme Court held) and a bad idea.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">I believe    the Administration&#146;s use of executive authority to over-classify    information is a bad idea.

She stated that kids are throwing their lunches    away because they are so &#147;nasty&#148;.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">These    new lunch requirements have been noted by the nutrition directors    at high schools who are now asking that the Department of Agriculture    loosen the reins on their requirements. A high school senior    in Georgia says that it is Mrs. Obama&#146;s fault but also must    the fault of others as well. He said that he is sure the servers    are just doing what they are told and that it can&#146;t just    be one person&#146;s fault. He stated that most of the students    will deal with the lunches they are served but a lot of them    bring their own lunch now instead of getting it through the school.    Most of the complaints are that the &#147;healthier&#148; food    does not look edible.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">The law    that put these new standards into schools around the country    is called the Healthy and Hunger-Free Kids Act which was put    into action by Mrs. Obama. School cafeterias are worried for    the students as they are not eating a lot of the food they are    given. It was found however that the problem does not lie on    Mrs. Obama&#146;s shoulders. The Department of Agriculture made    the standards and some of the schools are having a hard time    adjusting. One student sent a message on Twitter showing a photo    of a sad-looking chicken sandwich and a carton of 1% milk stating    this was all they had to each for lunch. The school however was    not in compliance with the new standards as there were no fruits    or veggies given.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">The new    requirements are that the meals must offer:</FONT></P>    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">- Whole    grains<BR>    - Low-fat or fat-free Milk<BR>    - Fruits<BR>    - Vegetables<BR>    - Protein</FONT></P>    <P><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">The students    can decline two out of those five requirements but they are forced    to take one veggie or fruit. That does not mean that they will    eat it however. The problem is that teens are so used to eating    junk food in large portions that they are going to be dissatisfied    no matter what the new requirements are.</FONT></P>    <P><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="+2" FACE="Arial Narrow">Obama    transparency</FONT></B></P>    <P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="+2" FACE="Arial Narrow"><IMG     SRC="1404TRANSPARENT.JPG" WIDTH="490" HEIGHT="653" ALIGN="BOTTOM"    BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"><BR>    </FONT><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow"><A HREF="http://t.co/o2tHIV8Jjo">List    of all 10 unclassified opinions authored <BR>    by DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel in 2013</A></FONT></B></CENTER></P>    <P><A HREF="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/elements/2014/04/the-end-of-net-neutrality.html"><B><FONT     SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">Obama backed net neutrality when    he wanted your vote</FONT></B></A></P>    <P><A HREF="http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire/matt-taibbi-bush-tougher-than-obama-corporate-america?utm_content=bufferf1eae&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer"><B><FONT     SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">Bush was tougher on Wall Street    criminals than Obama</FONT></B></A></P>    <P><CENTER><B><FONT COLOR="#990000" SIZE="+2" FACE="Arial Narrow"><IMG     SRC="1403beclear.jpg" WIDTH="480" HEIGHT="720" ALIGN="BOTTOM"    BORDER="0" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></FONT></B></CENTER></P>    <P><A HREF="http://time.com/27443/study-obama-administration-more-secretive-than-ever/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+timeblogs%2Fswampland+%28TIME%3A+Swampland%29"><B><FONT     SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">Obamadmin most secretive ever</FONT></B></A></P>    <P><A HREF="http://thehill.com/business-a-lobbying/business-a-lobbying/200404-unions-fear-obama-leaning-toward-a-new-deal-sell-off"><B><FONT     SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">Obama considering trashing one    of New Deal's great achievements</FONT></B></A></P>    <P><A HREF="http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/domestic-taxes/272957-obama-says-his-economic-policies-so-mainstream-hed-be-seen-as-moderate-republican-in-1980s#ixzz2vgMFZcAk "><B><FONT     SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">Word; From the man himself</FONT></B></A></P>    <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">&quot;The truth of the    matter is that my policies are so mainstream that if I had set    the same policies that I had back in the 1980s, I would be considered    a moderate Republican,&quot; <I>Obama in 2012 to Noticias Univision    23.</I></FONT></P>    <P><A HREF="http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2014/feb/23/what-is-barack-obama-presidency-for"><B><FONT     SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">What the hell is Barack Obama's    presidency for?</FONT></B></A></P>    <P><A HREF="http://wonkviz.tumblr.com/post/74946590081/obama-issues-fewer-executive-orders-than-any-president"><B><FONT     SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">Obama has issued fewest executive    orders per month since Grover Cleveland</FONT></B></A></P>    <P><A HREF="http://www.activistpost.com/2013/11/23-obama-quotes-that-turned-out-to-be.html"><B><FONT     SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">25 best lies of Obama</FONT></B></A></P>    <P><B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">Why    does it seem like Obama</FONT></B><FONT COLOR="#000000" SIZE="+1"     FACE="Arial Narrow"> is no longer our president but only a spokesman?

Wayne Madsen and Bill    Blum provides new light on the subject. To understand this phenomenon,    it is important to recognize that if a young Obama was vetted    or otherwise used by the CIA, it was not all that unusual. From    the 1950s on, the agency repeatedly interfered in the education    of the talented young by recruiting or co-opting them for its    own purposes. Yale's Skull &amp; Bones Club, for example, was    a classic case of a recruitment camp for future intelligence    types. The purpose - for the short run - is more information,    and - for the long run - a supply of US future government officials    whom the agency trusts and can use. And it often begins with    a bright college student an insider thinks might fill the bill.    . . .</FONT></I></P>    <P><A HREF="http://www.waynemadsenreport.com/articles/20090915_3"><B><FONT     SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">Wayne Madsen Report </FONT></B><FONT     SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">-</FONT></A><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">    WMR has obtained additional details on Business International    Corporation, the CIA front company where President Obama spent    a year working after graduating from Columbia University in 1983.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">BIC used journalists as    non-official cover agents around the world.

WMR was told that the Obama/Soetoro trip to Pakistan, ostensibly    to go 'partridge hunting' with the Soomros, related to unknown    CIA business.

In his autobiography,    &quot;Dreams From My Fathers&quot;, Barack Obama writes of taking    a job at some point after graduating from Columbia University    in 1983. He describes his employer as &quot;a consulting house    to multinational corporations&quot; in New York City, and his    functions as a &quot;research assistant&quot; and &quot;financial    writer.&quot; The odd part of Obama's story is that he doesn't    mention the name of his employer.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">However, a New York Times    story of 2007 identifies the company as Business International    Corporation. Equally odd is that the Times did not remind its    readers that the newspaper itself had disclosed in 1977 that    Business International had provided cover for four CIA employees    in various countries between 1955 and 1960. The British journal,    Lobster Magazine -- which, despite its incongruous name, is a    venerable international publication on intelligence matters --    has reported that Business International was active in the 1980s    promoting the candidacy of Washington-favored candidates in Australia    and Fiji. In 1987, the CIA overthrew the Fiji government after    but one month in office because of its policy of maintaining    the island as a nuclear-free zone, meaning that American nuclear-powered    or nuclear-weapons-carrying ships could not make port calls.    After the Fiji coup, the candidate supported by Business International,    who was much more amenable to Washington's nuclear desires, was    reinstated to power.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">In his book, not only    doesn't Obama mention his employer's name; he fails to say when    he worked there, or why he left the job. There may well be no    significance to these omissions, but inasmuch as Business International    has a long association with the world of intelligence, covert    actions, and attempts to penetrate the radical left -- including    Students for a Democratic Society -- it's valid to wonder if    the inscrutable Mr. Obama is concealing something about his own    association with this world.</FONT></P>    <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">Colony Net, 2008 -    I</FONT></B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">n an effort to    shore up his foreign policy credentials during the primary campaign,    the junior senator from Illinois - then in a tight primary contest    with Hillary Clinton in Pennsylvania - bragged about the time    he had spent in Pakistan. He argued that Clinton's foreign policy    &quot;experience&quot; consisted only of quick photo ops, while    he had spent &quot;quality time&quot; with &quot;real people.&quot;    Not only that, he had actually gone on a partridge-hunting trip    near the Pakistan city of Larkana. His partridge-hunting apparently    impressed the gun owners of Pennsylvania very little, inasmuch    as Clinton won that primary by 10 per cent.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">Eager to impress the Pennsylvania    crowd with his &quot;foreign policy experience&quot; and knowledge    of guns, Obama thus let slip the fact that he'd been to Pakistan.    (It is believed that he made two trips to Pakistan.) There must    have been more to that trip than meets the eye, however, because    the candidate has said virtually nothing about it since. You    won't find anything on the Obama campaign site. . .</FONT></P>    <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">Astute readers may have    begun to wonder how a struggling young college student with a    divorced, middle-class mother managed to fund a three week trip    to Pakistan. . . But Barry Obama-Soetoro was off shooting partridges    in Pakistan, hosted by a young man named Muhammed Hasan Chandio.    Chandio's family owned a substantial amount of land in the region,    and Obama apparently met him while both were students. (Chandio    is currently a financial consultant in New York, and a donor    to the Obama campaign.). . .</FONT></P>    <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">Another of Obama's hosts    in Pakistan was Muhammadian Mian Soomro, Obama's senior by about    11 years, son of a Pakistani politician and himself a politician,    who became interim President of Pakistan when Pervez Musharraf    resigned in August of 2008. Soomro has said that &quot;someone&quot;    personally requested that he &quot;watch over&quot; Barack Obama,    but will not name that individual . . .</FONT></P>    <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">A trip to Pakistan is    no doubt more than a jaunt to a Florida beach. Few Americans    would consider traveling there now, thinking it to be a dangerous    place. In 1981, when one of Obama's possible two trips there    occurred, it was less safe. Because of the war between Afghanistan    and the Soviet Union, millions of Afghan refugees fled to Pakistan,    which was under martial law. The Afghan &quot;mujahedeen&quot;    fighters had bases in Pakistan, and they moved back and forth    to fight the Soviets. . .</FONT></P>    <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">In the early 1980s, Pakistan    was one of the destinations Americans were prohibited from visiting    - it was on the State Department's list of banned countries.    Non-Muslims were not welcome, unless they were on official business,    formalized through the embassy of the country of origin. The    simple truth is that no young American would have a reason to    or be able to visit Pakistan in 1981, unless he was on official    government business of which the State Department was aware.    . .</FONT></P>    <P><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">Adding to the mix is the    fact that Ann Dunham, Obama's mother, had visited at least 13    countries in her lifetime, and had worked for companies that    required travel to Pakistan. Her employers appear to have included    the U.S. Agency for International Development, the Ford Foundation,    Women's World Bank, and the Asian Development Bank.

ELITE</FONT></B></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">SAM SMITH</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Sure, Obama is an elitist. I thought    it the first time I saw him. The tone, the dress, the moves,    the constant pretense of being in deep thought, the patronizing    explanation replacing impassioned argument. Another smart-ass    from an Ivy League law school. The ones that talk grandly and    carry a little feather. We've got a lot of them in Washington.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">That's why many white liberals went    for him. He was comfortably familiar in all but hue. They treat    him like a prophet but in fact he's just another of the black    ivies who are riding the political waves these days. For Obama    and Patrick Deval it was Harvard, for Mayor Nutter of Philadelphia    it was the Wharton School at Penn, for DC's Mayor Fenty is was    Oberlin and for Newark's Cory Book it was Oxford on a Rhodes    Scholarship. Not bad if you can't have a mother who was Irish    or latino.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">But it's not as politically wonderful    as it seems to some. St. Barack still can't get comfortably past    one of the sleaziest politicians in his party's modern history    and shows up weakly in matches against a guy who hasn't done    anything worth remembering since Vietnam. His purported magnificence    somehow fails to make the same impression at the polls as it    does at the rallies and fundraisers of the well committed.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">That's not surprising but it's worth    noting and suggests a bit more humility in the Obama camp wouldn't    hurt. <BR>    Of course, humility is not highly valued there. After all, it    takes something beyond ordinary self-confidence to move from    state senator to presidential candidate without even finishing    your freshman term in the Senate.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">On the other hand, Obama's not a    corrupt and conniving cad nor a decrepit warrior looking for    another dogfight, so it looks like he's the best we're going    to get.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">And it's not totally his fault that    he sees himself as God's gift to his party and his country. His    elitism is not really the problem; it is the elitism of those    who convinced him of this: the white liberals.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">These are the people who couldn't    stand John Edwards, the candidate who came closest to the New    Deal and Great Society values of any Democratic leader in decades.    But his policies didn't move them, only his accent and haircut.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">This is not a new problem. I wrote    about it almost two decades ago:</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Today's liberals seem to lack a    sense of politics as war, in which one constantly rearranges    the order of battle to win one's ultimate objective. They see    politics more as a secular form of religion in which success    is judged not by societal change but by the rigor with which    the faith is maintained. They are political fundamentalists and,    like religious fundamentalists, as far removed from their liberal    heritage as Pat Robertson is from Jesus.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">As with the religious fundamentalists,    the liberal true believers often miss the point. The canon becomes    particularized and heavily a matter of style and form. They know    how to speak like liberals to other liberals but not how to talk    to the rest of the world.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">The result is a strange distortion    of liberal priorities. Gut issues of immense potential popularity    such as health, housing, job creation and education are left    by the wayside in favor of issues that, no matter how worthy    they may be, are most likely to alienate liberalism from the    largest number of Americans.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">This then is Obama's problem now:    not so much that he's an elitist but that he's surrounded by    them, funded by them, guided by them - and for too long has been    trying to imitate them. If Ed Rendell was not so foolishly infatuated    with the latest pretender to the Bush-Clinton duopoly, he might    take Obama aside and give him a few lessons in talking like a    real person again. Look at what a good job Rendell is doing making    Clinton sound like one.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">But Obama doesn't seemed blessed    by that sort of advice. Both his white liberal and black constituencies    love him too much for getting this far and wouldn't think of    suggesting that he dismount his great stallion and reach out    beyond the Ebenezer Baptist - Harvard Law axis to people who    are seeking something more.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">It wouldn't be hard.

From an    article in Counterpunch]</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">CLASS ACTION REFORM: In 2005, Obama    joined Republicans in passing a law dubiously called the Class    Action Fairness Act that would shut down state courts as a venue    to hear many class action lawsuits. Long a desired objective    of large corporations and President George Bush, Obama in effect    voted to deny redress in many of the courts where these kinds    of cases have the best chance of surviving corporate legal challenges.    Instead, it forces them into the backlogged Republican-judge    dominated federal courts. By contrast, Senators Clinton, Edwards    and Kerry joined 23 others to vote against CAFA, noting the &quot;reform&quot;    was a thinly-veiled &quot;special interest extravaganza&quot;    that favored banking, creditors and other corporate interests.    . .</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">CREDIT CARD INTEREST RATES: Obama    has a way of ducking hard votes or explaining away his bad votes    by trying to blame poorly-written statutes. Case in point: an    amendment he voted on as part of a recent bankruptcy bill before    the US Senate would have capped credit card interest rates at    30 percent. Inexplicably, Obama voted against it, although it    would have been the beginning of setting these predatory lending    rates under federal control. Even Senator Hillary Clinton supported    it. Now Obama explains his vote by saying the amendment was poorly    written or set the ceiling too high. His explanation isn't credible    as Obama offered no lower number as an alternative, and didn't    put forward his own amendment clarifying whatever language he    found objectionable.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">LIMITING NON-ECONOMIC DAMAGES: These    seemingly unusual votes wherein Obama aligns himself with Republican    Party interests aren't new. While in the Illinois Senate, Obama    voted to limit the recovery that victims of medical malpractice    could obtain through the courts. Capping non-economic damages    in medical malpractice cases means a victim cannot fully recover    for pain and suffering or for punitive damages. Moreover, it    ignored that courts were already empowered to adjust awards when    appropriate, and that the Illinois Supreme Court had previously    ruled such limits on tort reform violated the state constitution.    . .</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">MINING LAW OF 1872: In November    2007, Obama came out against a bill that would have reformed    the notorious Mining Law of 1872. The current statute, signed    into law by Ulysses Grant, allows mining companies to pay a nominal    fee, as little as $2.50 an acre, to mine for hardrock minerals    like gold, silver, and copper without paying royalties. . . The    Hardrock Mining and Reclamation Act of 2007 would have finally    overhauled the law and allowed American taxpayers to reap part    of the royalties. . . Later it came to light that one of Obama's    key advisors in Nevada is a Nevada-based lobbyist in the employ    of various mining companies</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">ENERGY POLICY: On energy policy,    it turns out Obama is a big supporter of corn-based ethanol which    is well known for being an energy-intensive crop to grow. It    is estimated that seven barrels of oil are required to produce    eight barrels of corn ethanol, according to research by the Cato    Institute. Ethanol's impact on climate change is nominal and    isn't &quot;green&quot; according to Alisa Gravitz, Co-op America    executive director. &quot;It simply isn't a major improvement    over gasoline when it comes to reducing our greenhouse gas emissions.&quot;    . . . Obama voted in favor of $8 billion worth of corn subsidies    in 2006 alone, when most of that money should have been committed    to alternative energy sources such as solar, tidal and wind.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">SINGLE-PAYER HEALTH CARE: Obama    opposed single-payer bill HR676, sponsored by Congressmen Dennis    Kucinich and John Conyers in 2006, although at least 75 members    of Congress supported it. . . Obama's own plan has been widely    criticized for leaving health care industry administrative costs    in place and for allowing millions of people to remain uninsured.    &quot;Sicko&quot; filmmaker Michael Moore ridiculed it saying,    &quot;Obama wants the insurance companies to help us develop    a new health care plan-the same companies who have created the    mess in the first place.&quot;</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">NORTH AMERICAN FREE TRADE AGREEMENT:    Regarding the North American Free Trade Agreement, Obama recently    boasted, &quot;I don't think NAFTA has been good for Americans,    and I never have.&quot; Yet, Calvin Woodward reviewed Obama's    record on NAFTA in a February 26, 2008 Associated Press article    and found that comment to be misleading: &quot;In his 2004 Senate    campaign, Obama said the US should pursue more deals such as    NAFTA, and argued more broadly that his opponent's call for tariffs    would spark a trade war.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">SOME FINAL EXAMPLES: On March 2,    2007 Obama gave a speech at AIPAC, America's pro-Israeli government    lobby, wherein he disavowed his previous support for the plight    of the Palestinians. . .</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">He wouldn't have his picture taken    with San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom when visiting San Francisco    for a fundraiser in his honor because Obama was scared voters    might think he supports gay marriage . . .</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Obama acknowledges the disproportionate    impact the death penalty has on blacks, but still supports it,    while other politicians are fighting to stop it. . .</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Obama aggressively opposed initiating    impeachment proceedings against the president and he wouldn't    even support Wisconsin Senator Russ Feingold's effort to censure    the Bush administration for illegally wiretapping American citizens    in violation of the 1978 Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act.    . .</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">http://counterpunch.com/gonzalez02292008.html</FONT></P>    <P><A HREF="http://www.seacoastonline.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080213/NEWS/80213011"><B><FONT     SIZE="+2" FACE="Arial Narrow">STRANGE COINCIDENCES</FONT></B></A></P>    <P><TABLE WIDTH="98%" BORDER="1" CELLSPACING="2" CELLPADDING="0">      <TR>        <TD WIDTH="50%">        <P><CENTER>&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvaOkxbM9dY&eurl=http:/bigheaddc.com/2008/02/17/obama-caught-plagiarizing-2006-deval-patrick-speech/"><IMG         SRC="802PATRICK.JPG" WIDTH="200" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0" HEIGHT="168"        NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A></CENTER></P>        <P><CENTER><A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xvaOkxbM9dY&eurl=http:/bigheaddc.com/2008/02/17/obama-caught-plagiarizing-2006-deval-patrick-speech/"><B><FONT         FACE="Arial Narrow">DEVAL PATRICK 2006</FONT></B></A></CENTER></TD>        <TD WIDTH="50%" VALIGN="TOP">        <P><CENTER>&nbsp;<A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgMcht-EW6I&eurl=http:/bigheaddc.com/2008/02/17/obama-caught-plagiarizing-2006-deval-patrick-speech/"><IMG         SRC="802OBAMAWORDS.JPG" WIDTH="200" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"        HEIGHT="159" NATURALSIZEFLAG="2"></A></CENTER></P>        <P><CENTER><A HREF="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SgMcht-EW6I&eurl=http:/bigheaddc.com/2008/02/17/obama-caught-plagiarizing-2006-deval-patrick-speech/"><B><FONT         FACE="Arial Narrow">OBAMA 2008</FONT></B></A></CENTER></TD>      </TR>    </TABLE></P>    <P><A HREF="http://www.dlc.org/ndol_ci.cfm?kaid=86&subid=191&contentid=254329"><B><FONT     SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">ONE DEGREE OF SEPARATION</FONT></B></A></P>    <P><A HREF="http://radiovice.blogspot.com/2008/02/oh-obamaaaaaa-insert-fainting-now.html"><B><FONT     SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">WE SHALL BE OVERCOME</FONT></B></A></P>    <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">OH BUMMER</FONT></B></P>    <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">SAM SMITH</FONT></B></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">I am already in trouble for not    being sufficiently enthusiastic about Barack Obama and the dude    hasn't even been nominated yet.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">I even wrote that he was the best    candidate who could possibly win, albeit adding that this was    more cause for concern than for joy.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">But the days when you took someone's    vote and didn't ask too many questions are apparently over. In    modern liberalism, you not only have to be on the right side    but for the right reasons.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">And so now, according to one blog,    I am &quot;excoriating Barack Obama&quot; and full of &quot;fear    and loathing.&quot; Another reader writes to say, &quot;you nay-sayers    can either get on the train or get out of the way.&quot; Even    two-thirds of my immediate family is on my case.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Yet before I am dragged off to my    first Skeptics Anonymous meeting, let me try to explain why I    haven't turned to Barack with appropriate enthusiasm and faith.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Just writing that seems silly. After    all, until now even missionaries understood that it was their    job to convert and not the heathens' task to justify their apathy    and doubt.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">On the other hand, I have been through    this before. It wasn't long after I began writing critically    of Bill Clinton that I became a &quot;Clinton hater,&quot; a    marvelous piece of snake oil semiotics in which the Clintonistas    claimed the status of oppressed peoples while his opponents were    dumped amongst the ranks of anti-Semites and the KKK.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">One of the few pleasures of the    last eight years, despite regularly excoriating the Bush regime,    has been that no one has called me a &quot;hater.&quot; In fact,    in fifty years of journalism, Clinton is apparently the only    politician I have ever &quot;hated.&quot; The rest I have just    criticized or exposed. I thought I was doing the same thing with    Clinton but then I didn't yet understand post-modern politics.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">All along, I just thought I was    doing my job, serving my readers instead of power, the latter    being the preferred cause of the more conventional media which    has never understood the difference between objectivity and obsequiousness.    Twenty years ago, I put it this way:</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">&quot;The preoccupation of the press    with power, in no small part, is a reflection of its own social    ambitions rather than an accurate description of the world. The    erstwhile dictum that the only way for a journalist to look at    a politician is down his nose has been replaced by the dictum:    don't bite the source that feeds and glamorizes you.&quot;</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">By the way, the politician the press    was protecting then was named Ronald Reagan. Its love of power    is quite non-partisan and the reader has become its non-partisan    victim.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Then there's the problem of policy.    I call it life but apparently the correct word is policy. In    pro-Obama writings you find a dismissive approach towards &quot;policies&quot;    as though they were nice things as long as hidden away in statements    or for fellows at the Brookings Institution, but not the real    - like enthusiasm, hope and faith.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Here's where I fail again. I actually    think providing Americans with decent healthcare and housing    and ending usurious interest rates is more important than having    a nice president talking with enthusiasm about hope and faith.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Where did I pick up this odd idea?    From the Democratic Party, which from Roosevelt to Lyndon Johnson    had it as a central thesis. Which is why we have a minimum wage,    Medicare, Social Security and some modicum of control over banks    and investment firms. Social Security once symbolized real hope    to Americans. Now Obama symbolizes hope and, according to him,    everything about Social Security is &quot;on the table.&quot;</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Sadly, for anyone under 35 there    has hardly been a measure passed in their lifetime that would    give much credibility to &quot;policies.&quot; But it is possible.    Consider what that evil man Richard Nixon did. He proposed a    healthcare plan to the left of either Obama or Clinton. This    plan included a provision in which any American could sign up    for Medicaid paying on a sliding income scale. He indexed Social    Security for inflation, created the Environmental Protection    Agency and OSHA as well as the first real federal affirmative    action program. If a guy as bad as Nixon could do all that, shouldn't    we expect a bit more from the sainted Barack Obama?</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Then there's the politics of the    situation. In the old Democratic Party, liberals instinctively    understood they were fighting a two front war: one front against    the Republicans and the other against the bad guys in their own    party: George Wallace, Strom Thurmond, Carmine DeSapio, Richard    Daley etc. With Clinton, the liberal wing of the party became    gutless puppets of the Democratic Abandonship Council.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Compare that with the Republicans    who reached their modern pinnacle in a state of constant internal    conflict that goes on to this day. It is interesting to speculate    on whether liberals, if they had been as assertive within their    own party as the GOP right, might not have had similar results.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">One other thing: I suffer from the    delusion that if I want words put together well I should go to    a bookstore and not to a political speech. As George Orwell noted,    &quot;in our time, political speech and writing are largely the    defense of the indefensible. Thus political language has to consist    largely of euphemisms, question-begging and sheer cloudy vagueness.&quot;</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">In one debate, for example, Obama    and Clinton spent a half hour on healthcare and no one noticed    that their entire purpose was to defend programs designed to    protect the useless and destructive private insurance industry.    I would feel quite differently about Obama's language if he used    the words &quot;single payer&quot; as often as he does &quot;hope.&quot;</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Finally, if they insist on talking    about hope, I've got the Obamists beat. My optimism far exceeds    theirs because I truly believe we could have done better than    Barack Obama. And still can some day.</FONT></P>    <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">WHY CHEERING IS BAD    FOR YOUR HEALTH</FONT></B></P>    <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Sam Smith</FONT></B></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Two essential facts about the presidential    campaign:</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">1. Of the present candidates who    could possibly be elected, Barack Obama is clearly the best.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">2. This is more cause for concern    than for hope.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Symbolizing the new Middle Ages    in which we live - in which thought and action are guided by    media-driven myth (as opposed to the church-driven myth of the    earlier medieval era) - Obama has arrived at his status without    record, without programs and without a vision beyond a collection    of trite but effective evangelical cliches. He is, however, of    the right mythical looks, age and color.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Early in the campaign, I compared    him to Chauncy Gardiner aka Chance the Gardener, an earlier manifestation    of magnificent nothingness to appear on the American political    scene - albeit the fiction of Chance was safely contained in    the movie &quot;Being There&quot; while Obama was running for    election to a real White House.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">In the final scene, reports Wikipedia,    &quot;Chance is seen apparently walking across the surface of    a lake while the most important movers and shakers in the USA    discuss running him for President. This scene continues to generate    discussion and controversy. Clearly we see Chance walking on    water, an act with a clear biblical reference. . . Is there a    prosaic explanation, such as hidden stepping-stones? Or is Chance    the Savior (as so many of the characters are looking for)? Does    he truly possess some special grace, given his simple innocence    and simply being present to each moment without filters and ideas?    In his 2001 book, The Great Movies, Roger Ebert argues for the    latter interpretation. Another view is that the director (and    the author) are simply asking the audience: &quot;How much more    would you have believed? We've been kidding you all along you    know!&quot;</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">The novel upon which the movie was    based was written over thirty years ago by Jerzy Kosinski. The    Obama candidacy may elevate Kosinksi to one of the most prescient    political authors of modern times. After all, what is more Obamesque    than the sort of phrase that got Chance started? - &quot;In the    garden, growth has its seasons. First comes spring and summer,    but then we have fall and winter. And then we get spring and    summer again.&quot;</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">If you think that's an exaggeration,    consider this from Chauncy Obama: &quot;If you're walking down    the right path and you're willing to keep walking, eventually    you'll make progress.&quot;</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">So here we are. We don't know what    we have and we don't know what we're going to get. But to many    it looks great.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Yet one thing is certain. The current    mindless infatuation of Obama's supporters, while harmless enough    with a rock star, will do our politics and our lives no good.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">We have, after all, some experience    with this. Obama isn't the first Democratic candidate to try    to ride into town on the back of hope. Bill Clinton brought the    whole town of Hope with him but by the end of his first term    the word had all but dropped from sight.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Instead, Clinton mangled the social    democracy of his predecessors, raised corruption to new heights    and paved the way for the Bush regime, aided in no small part    by the groupiesque infatuation among the liberal class.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">If there was one thing we should    have learned from the Clinton years is the danger of adoring    politicians instead of pragmatically using them.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Sadly, however, the last presidential    candidate to even hint at this was Eugene Debs who said once,    &quot;Too long have the workers of the world waited for some    Moses to lead them out of bondage. He has not come; he never    will come. I would not lead you out if I could for if you could    be led out, you could be led back again.&quot;</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Instead, we have a candidate who    declares, &quot;We are the ones we've been waiting for. . . We    are the change that we seek.&quot;</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Instead, we have a candidate who    says, &quot;My job this morning is to be so persuasive . . .    that a light will shine through that window, a beam of light    will come down upon you, you will experience an epiphany, and    you will suddenly realize that you must go to the polls and vote    for Barack.&quot;</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">As Joe Klein noted in Time, &quot;the    campaign is entirely about Obama and his ability to inspire.    Rather than focusing on any specific issue or cause - other than    an amorphous desire for change - the message is becoming dangerously    self-referential. The Obama campaign all too often is about how    wonderful the Obama campaign is.&quot;</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">The blogger Barhu writes, &quot;What    I find interesting about Obama is how narcissistic he is with    his own rhetorical gifts. With so many millions of people finding    so much inspiration in his rhetoric, what is it, exactly, that    he is trying to inspire them to do? Has he made appeals to his    young followers to join the military, the Peace Corps, Teach    For America? Has he inspired them to give back to his country,    to seek out public service, to serve, as John McCain has implored    his followers, a cause greater than ourselves? Has he inspired    his over-educated, overpaid followers to raise money for victims    of Katrina or the tornadoes, to lobby for higher taxes, to sacrifice    any of their wealth or intellect in the service of America? Has    he tried, in any way, shape or form, to use his gifts to inspire    his minions to become apart of the fabric of public service,    to improve our nation through volunteerism, charitable donations,    self service of any kind whatsoever?</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">&quot;No. The only thing Barack    Obama has ever inspired anyone to do is vote for Barack Obama.&quot;</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">This is the technique of generations    of hustlers, many of them generating their con from the pulpit,    others leading pseudo-psychological workshops, and a few - the    most dangerous - with whole armies behind them. If you listen    to Obama with any sense of history, you can not but be concerned.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Still the alternative is the atrocious    Clinton or the egregious McCain and there is no suggestion here    that these are better choices. Only that voters - instead of    being reduced to hand clapping, check writing automatons - understand    what they are getting with their vote and that, if that vote    succeeds, they must be constantly on guard, know when to oppose    and when to, as Pogo once put it, stand up on the piano and demand    outrage action. We are not getting a savior, but at best an occasional    ally.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">We should be no less cautious of    our politicians than the Roman Church is of its potential saints.    The Guardian described John Paul II as having to go through the    following:</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">&quot;Theological experts will review    John Paul's published works to determine if they are theologically    sound, a historical commission will gather information to document    his life, and Rev D'Alonzo and Monsignour Oder will start interviewing    witnesses.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">&quot;When the material is gathered,    the Vatican appoints a commission to review the case and make    a final report to the Pope for him to decide if John Paul led    a life of 'heroic virtue'&quot;.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">&quot;If he does, and the Vatican    then confirms a miracle has occurred after John Paul's death    thanks to his intercession, he can be beatified. A second miracle    is needed for him to be made a saint.&quot;</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Mind you, we are choosing something    far more important than a mere saint; we are selecting a president    - and, theoretically, not one to serve but to serve us. To the    extent we ignore this difference, we approach the point described    by Albert Camus to a German friend after the Second World War:    &quot;This is what separated us from you; we made demands. You    were satisfied to serve the power of your nation and we dreamed    of giving ours the truth.&quot;</FONT></P>    <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">IN SEARCH OF OBAMA</FONT></B></P>    <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">MONEY, ECONOMY &amp; LABOR</FONT></B></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">AUDACITY OF HOPE - &quot;Conservatives    and Bill Clinton were right about welfare&quot;</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">PAUL STREET - He opposed an amendment    to the Bankruptcy Act that would have capped credit card interest    rates at 30 percent.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Obama voted for a business-friendly    &quot;tort reform&quot; bill that rolls back working peoples'    ability to obtain reasonable redress and compensation from misbehaving    corporations</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">THE NATION - John Edwards and Hillary    Clinton are pledging substantial federal resources to stabilize    the mortgage market and intervene on behalf of borrowers. Barack    Obama's proposal is tepid by comparison, short on aggressive    government involvement and infused with conservative rhetoric    about fiscal responsibility. As he has done on domestic issues    like healthcare, job creation and energy policy, Obama is staking    out a position to the right of not only populist Edwards but    Clinton as well. . . Though he has been a proponent of mortgage    fraud legislation in the Senate, he has remained silent on further    financial regulations. And much like his broader economic stimulus    package, Obama's foreclosure plan mostly avoids direct government    spending in favor of a tax credit for homeowners, which amounts    to about $500 on average, beyond which only certain borrowers    would be eligible for help from an additional fund. . .</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Obama's disappointing foreclosure    plan stems from the centrist politics of his three chief economic    advisers and his campaign's ties to Wall Street institutions    opposed to increased financial regulation. David Cutler and Jeffrey    Liebman are both Harvard economists who served in the Clinton    Administration, and they work on market-oriented solutions to    social welfare issues. Cutler advocates improving healthcare    through financial incentives; Liebman, the partial privatization    of Social Security.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Austan Goolsbee, an economist at    the University of Chicago who calls himself a &quot;centrist    market economist,&quot; has been most directly involved with    crafting Obama's subprime agenda. . .

Obama had received nearly $10 million    in contributions from the finance, insurance and real estate    sector through October, and he's second among presidential candidates    of either party in money raised from commercial banks, trailing    only Clinton. Goldman Sachs, which made $6 billion from devalued    mortgage securities in the first nine months of 2007, is Obama's    top contributor.

Now Harvard    graduates come in all flavors, but too many of the most successful    ones learn quickly to gravitate to gratuitous gravitas. If you    watch Obama closely he seems in public to have only two moods,    happy or look-how-serious-I-am-about-this, the latter being the    quality that allows Washington officials - and Harvard Law grads    - to convince everyone else they should invade Iraq and Vietnam    or forget about global warming for the time being. The problem    is that, as one journalist noted, there is a big difference between    being somber and being serious. And gravitas - with which Obama    overflows - seems often just a karaoke version of seriousness.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">(If you are inclined to think that    college background is irrelevant, remember this: The Vietnam    war was in no small part the invention and obsession of machismo-seeking    Harvard grads and during the last twenty years of America's extraordinary    decline, our country has been in the hands of products of Yale:    two Bushes and a Clinton.)</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">The other difference I have with    many of my white friends is that I have lived and worked most    of my life in Washington, DC, which has as much pulpit borne    politics per square inch as any place in the country. When Obama    does his Martin Luther King cover, therefore, what comes to mind    is not &quot;I have a Dream&quot; but, &quot;Oh no, not again,&quot;    for it brings to mind crummy council members and dubious mayors    being propelled into office with the help of similar irrelevant    rhetoric.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">The fact is that King is long dead    and black preachers, just like white ones, don't act like that    much any more regardless of their comfortable cadences. The ministry    - white and black - has walked away from the 1960s and its values    just as surely as have the politicians and the media. So when    someone tries to pull the noble preacher shtick, I feel more    like I'm being conned than being converted.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">The alternative to this is to spend    less time looking for Jesus or JFK and MLK and more time seeking    policies and a politics with which one is comfortable.

This view has now been confirmed by the Washington Post's conservative    editorial page editor, Fred Hiatt</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">FRED HIATT, WASHINGTON POST - [Barack    Obama and Mitt Romney] have laid out their foreign policy visions    in parallel articles, released prior to publication in the July/August    issue of Foreign Affairs. And after you cut through some of their    campaign rhetoric, here's what you find:</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">(1) The two candidates' programs    are strikingly similar to each other.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">(2) Both are strikingly similar    to Bush administration policy.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">(3) And both, far from retreating    to isolationism in the face of Iraq and other challenges, set    forth their own wildly ambitious calls for American leadership    and the promotion of American values. &quot;Boldness&quot; is    an operative word for both of them.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Obama begins: &quot;After Iraq,    we may be tempted to turn inward. That would be a mistake. The    American moment is not over, but it must be seized anew.&quot;</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Romney writes: &quot;In the aftermath    of World War II and with the coming of the Cold War, members    of the 'greatest generation' united America and the free world    around shared values and actions that changed history. . . .    Our times call for equally bold leadership.&quot;</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">The two differ in some respects,    of course. Romney puts more emphasis on combating radical Islam    and less on promoting freedom. Obama dwells more on Bush's failures    and the value of diplomacy and endorses a &quot;phased withdrawal&quot;    of U.S. troops from Iraq. But even there, the differences are    not as stark as the candidates would like them to appear. Obama    would maintain in Iraq enough troops &quot;to protect American    personnel and facilities, continue training Iraqi security forces,    and root out al Qaeda.&quot;</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">And the similarities dwarf the differences.    Both want bigger, not smaller, armed forces: Obama calls for    an additional 92,000 ground troops, Romney for 100,000.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Obama calls for a doubling of foreign    aid; Romney wants a Marshall Plan-like &quot;Partnership for    Prosperity and Progress&quot; that would support schools, microcredit,    the rule of law, human rights, health care and the free market    in Islamic states.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Romney says that &quot;the jihadist    threat is the defining challenge of our generation,&quot; as    real as the threat that was posed by Nazi Germany and Stalin's    Soviet Union, and he promises an appropriately sized response.    Obama, albeit using slightly different terms, agrees: &quot;To    defeat al Qaeda, I will build a twenty-first-century military    and twenty-first-century partnerships as strong as the anticommunist    alliance that won the Cold War to stay on the offense everywhere    from Djibouti to Kandahar.&quot;. . .</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">In both cases, the criticism is    not that Bush took on too much but that he accomplished too little.    &quot;We are a unique nation, and there is no substitute for    our leadership,&quot; says Romney.

It is so easy to drift    into a colloquial world in which habit, cliche and spin conspire    to make one an unconscious co-conspirator in the myths of the    time.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">For example, I've been calling Barack    Obama black.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Yet the only way Obama is black    is if one accepts a definition that is culturally rather than    scientifically derived.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">White liberals want Obama to be    black because it helps them feel that this election is another    freedom ride and blacks accept Obama as black in a long tradition    of turning the majority's cruelty to their own purposes, thus    expanding their base in American society.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">As a scientific matter, however,    race is a racist concept and doesn't exist. It was invented as    a tool of prejudice and still manages to survive despite even    DNA evidence to the contrary. Race is to culture as intelligent    design is to evolution. Here's the way I put in The Great American    Political Repair Manual:</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">|||||</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">What are considered genetic characteristics    are often the result of cultural habit and environmental adaptation.    As far back as 1785, a German philosopher noted that &quot;complexions    run into each other.&quot; Julian Huxley suggested in 1941 that    &quot;it would be highly desirable if we could banish the question-begging    term 'race' from all discussions of human affairs and substitute    the noncommittal phrase 'ethnic group.' That would be a first    step toward rational consideration of the problem at hand.&quot;    Anthropologist Ashley Montagu in 1942 called race our &quot;most    dangerous myth.&quot;</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Yet in our conversations and arguments,    in our media, and even in our laws, the illusion of race is given    great credibility. As a result, that which is transmitted culturally    is considered genetically fixed, that which is an environmental    adaptation is regarded as innate and that which is fluid is declared    immutable.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Many still hang on to a notion similar    to that of Carolus Linnaeus, who declared in 1758 that there    were four races: white, red, dark and black. Others make up their    own races, applying the term to religions (Jewish), language    groups (Aryan) or nationalities (Irish). Modern science has little    impact on our views.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Our concept of race comes largely    from religion, literature, politics, and the oral tradition.    It comes creaking with all the prejudices of the ages. It reeks    of territoriality, of jingoism, of subjugation, and of the abuse    of power.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">DNA research has revealed just how    great is our misconception of race. In The History and Geography    of Human Genes, Luca Cavalli-Sforza of Stanford and his colleagues    describe how many of the variations between humans are really    adaptations to different environmental conditions (such as the    relative density of sweat glands or lean bodies to dissipate    heat and fat ones to retain it). But that's not the sort of thing    you can easily build a system of apartheid around. As Thomas    S. Martin has written:</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">&quot;The widest genetic divergence    in human groups separates the Africans from the Australian aborigines,    though ironically these two 'races' have the same skin color.    . . There is no clearly distinguishable 'white race.' What Cavalli-Sforza    calls the Caucasoids are a hybrid, about two-thirds Mongoloid    and one-third African. Finns and Hungarians are slightly more    Mongoloid, while Italians and Spaniards are more African, but    the deviation is vanishingly slight.&quot;</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">|||||</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">One of the reasons that so many    consider Obama black is because of the one drop rule, which Wikipedia    explains like this:</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">||||</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">According to the United States'    colloquial term one drop rule, a black is any person with any    known African ancestry. The one drop rule is virtually unique    to the United States and was applied almost exclusively to blacks.    Outside of the US, definitions of who is black vary from country    to country but generally, multiracial people are not required    by society to identify themselves as black. The most significant    consequence of the one drop rule was that many African Americans    who had significant European ancestry, whose appearance was very    European, would identify themselves as black.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">The one drop rule originated as    a racist attempt to keep the white race pure, however one of    its unintended consequences was uniting the African American    community and preserving an African identity. Some of the most    prominent civil rights activists were multiracial but yet stood    up for equality for all. It is said the W.E.B. Du Bois could    have easily passed for white yet he became the preeminent scholar    in Afro-American studies. He chose to spend his final years in    Africa and immigrated to Ghana where he died aged 95. Other scholars    such as Booker T. Washington and Frederick Douglass both had    white fathers.[20] Even the more radical activists such as Malcolm    X and Louis Farrakhan both had white grandparents. That said,    colorism, or intraracial discrimination based on skin tone, does    affect the black community. It is a sensitive issue or a taboo    subject. Open discussions are often labeled as &quot;airing dirty    laundry.&quot;</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Many people in the United States    are increasingly rejecting the one drop rule, and are questioning    whether even as much as 50% black ancestry should be considered    black. Although politician Barack Obama self-identifies as black,    55 percent of whites and 61 percent of Hispanics classified him    as biracial instead of black after being told that his mother    is white. Blacks were less likely to acknowledge a multiracial    category, with 66% labeling Obama as black. However when it came    to Tiger Woods, only 42% of African-Americans described him as    black, as did only 7% of White Americans.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">||||</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">But politics isn't science; it isn't    even traditional culture. It's its own world. Thus we have a    man who hopes to be America's first black president whose only    upbringing by a black parent ended when he was two years old.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Barack Obama's mother is white.    His stepfather was Indonesian. The grandparents with whom he    was sent to live when he was ten were white. But according to    the media and his supporters, Obama is still black.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">In Obama's case this is a myth that's    a little hard to sustain, but by keeping his white relatives    sternly away from the media and by playing up his culturally    tangential connection to Kenya including a media-enhanced visit,    he's done an impressive job.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">But journalists aren't meant to    play along with myths. Obama isn't black. Since the word race    shouldn't even be used these days, it would be best to call him    bi-ethnic or multicultural. There's nothing wrong with this;    it just doesn't seem to attract as many votes and dollars.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">If you look at Obama's life from    a purely cultural standpoint, he is mainly part Indonesian and    part Hawaiian, impressive but not exactly the deep pockets campaign    fundraisers are looking for except for the fact that one of his    school mates was Steve Case.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">What is troubling about Obama's    past is not what it was, but what he and his supporters have    made it out to be. For example, it's dishonest to make his white    relatives off-limits to the press. It is misleading to make him    into an icon of American black culture. It is pure spin to give    so much mileage to a Kenyan father who left the family when Obama    was two and so little to his white mother or the white grandparents    who raised him.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">There is also a disturbing hidden    parallel between Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. Both had fathers    who failed their families. Both relied heavily on extended family    for the love and support parents are supposed to provide. Both    still seem to be seeking personal love and admiration in a massive    public forum. It may be an unfair comparison, but America certainly    suffered because of the screw-ups in Clinton's family. It should    be at least fair for Americans to wonder whether they want vote    themselves into another group therapy session.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">If Obama would campaign as a multi-cultural    candidate and tell us what - other than pulpit style cliches    - his messed up past might suggest in terms of public policy,    he would be a more honest and appealing candidate. He might help    us grow out of race. But his advisors probably already know that    the number of Americans willing to reveal their multi-cultural    past on Census forms is miniscule and actually dropping. And    he has clearly found that playing to the liberal evangelicals    is paying off.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">So instead, all we're getting is    another political fairy tale.</FONT></P>    <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">OBAMA'S WHITE MOTHER</FONT></B></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">CHICAGO TRIBUNE - For [Chip] Wall    and a few dozen others, Obama on the campaign trail often brings    to mind Stanley Ann Dunham, Obama's mother and a strong-willed,    unconventional member of the Mercer Island [WA] High School graduating    class of 1960. &quot;She was not a standard-issue girl of her    times. . .

I realized that I was to live with strangers.&quot;    This can't have been easy on a 10-year-old boy.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">&quot;Dreams from My Father&quot;    never directly grapples with the question of what these abandonments    did to shape Obama.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">MSNBC - At school, Obama was surrounded    by the island's richest and most accomplished students. America    Online founder Steve Case, actress Kelly Preston and former Dallas    Cowboys lineman Mark Tuinei, who died in 1999, attended the school    around that time. Pro golf sensation Michelle Wie, 17, is a student    there now.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17003563/</FONT></P>    <P><A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One_drop_rule"><B><FONT     SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">ONE DROP RULE</FONT></B></A></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">WIKIPEDIA - The one-drop rule is    a historical colloquial term in the United States that holds    that a person with any trace of sub-Saharan ancestry (however    small or invisible) cannot be considered white and so unless    said person has an alternative non-white ancestry they can claim,    such as Native American, Asian, Arab, Australian aboriginal,    they must be considered black.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">This notion of invisible - intangible    membership in a &quot;racial&quot; group has seldom been applied    to people of Native American ancestry. The notion has been largely    applied to those of black African ancestry. Langston Hughes wrote,    &quot;You see, unfortunately, I am not black. There are lots    of different kinds of blood in our family. But here in the United    States, the word 'Negro' is used to mean anyone who has any Negro    blood at all in his veins. In Africa, the word is more pure.    It means all Negro, therefore black. I am brown.&quot;. . .</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Before 1930, individuals of mixed    European and African ancestry had usually been classed as mulattoes,    sometimes as black and sometimes as white. The main purpose of    the one-drop rule was to prevent interracial relationships and    thus keep whites &quot;pure.&quot; In 1924 Plecker wrote, &quot;Two    races as materially divergent as the white and negro, in morals,    mental powers, and cultural fitness, cannot live in close contact    without injury to the higher.&quot; In line with this concept    was also the assumption that blacks would somehow be &quot;improved&quot;    through white intermixture. . .</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">In the case of Native American admixture    with whites the one-drop rule was extended only as far as those    with one-quarter Indian blood due to what was known as the &quot;Pocahontas    exception.&quot; The &quot;Pocahontas exception&quot; existed    because many influential Virginia families claimed descent from    Pocahontas. To avoid classifying them as non-white the Virginia    General Assembly declared that a person could be considered white    long as they had no more than one-sixteenth Indian blood.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">In 1967 the U.S. Supreme Court,    in its ruling on the case of Loving v. Virginia, conclusively    invalidated Plecker's Virginia Racial Integrity Act, along with    its key component, the one-drop rule, as unconstitutional. Despite    this holding, the one-drop theory is still influential in U.S.    society. Multiracial individuals with visible mixed European    and African and/or Native American ancestry are often still considered    non-white, unless they explicitly declare themselves white or    Anglo. . . By contrast these standards are widely rejected by    America's Latino community, the majority of whom are of mixed    ancestry, but for whom their Latino cultural heritage is more    important to their ethnic identities than &quot;race.&quot; The    one-drop rule is not generally applied to Latinos of mixed origin    or to Arab-Americans.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">The one drop rule does not apply    outside of the United States. Many other countries treat race    much less formally, and when they do self-identify racially,    they often do so in ways that surprise Americans. Just as a person    with physically recognizable sub-Saharan ancestry can claim to    be black in the United States, someone with recognizable Caucasian    ancestry may be considered white in Latin America. . .</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Professor J.B. Bird has said that    Latin America is not alone in rejecting the United States' notion    than any visible African ancestry is enough to make one black:    &quot; In most countries of the Caribbean, Colin Powell would    be described as a Creole, reflecting his mixed heritage. In Belize,    he might further be described as a 'High Creole', because of    his extremely light complexion.&quot;. . .</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Another consequence of the one-drop    rule is that multiracial children of Black and White couples    are less likely to self-identify as White as children of Asian    and White couples. . .</FONT></P>    <P><A NAME="nothing"></A><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">THE    POLITICS OF NOTHINGNESS<!--NOEDIT--><!--/NOEDIT--></FONT></B></P>    <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Sam Smith - </FONT></B><FONT     FACE="Arial Narrow">Perusing still more puerile pandering in    the cause of pacific politics by Barack Oblather, a vision suddenly    appeared. While, according to Google, a few others have already    experienced this transformational experience, it is still rare    enough to deserve mention.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">The apparition was, without doubt,    Chauncy Gardiner aka Chance the gardener, the last manifestation    of magnificent nothingness to appear on the American political    scene - albeit the fiction of Chance was safely contained in    the movie &quot;Being There&quot; while Obama is running for    election to a real White House.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Like Obama, no one knew where Chance    had come from. Even the CIA and FBI were unable to discover any    information, with each concluding he is a clever cover-up by    one of their own agents.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">In the final scene, reports Wikipedia,    &quot;Chance is seen apparently walking across the surface of    a lake while the most important movers and shakers in the USA    discuss running him for President. This scene continues to generate    discussion and controversy. Clearly we see Chance walking on    water, an act with a clear biblical reference. . . Is there a    prosaic explanation, such as hidden stepping-stones? Or is Chance    the Savior (as so many of the characters are looking for)? Does    he truly possess some special grace, given his simple innocence    and simply being present to each moment without filters and ideas?    In his 2001 book, The Great Movies, Roger Ebert argues for the    latter interpretation. Another view is that the director (and    the author) are simply asking the audience: &quot;How much more    would you have believed? We've been kidding you all along you    know!&quot;</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">The novel upon which the movie was    based was written over thirty years ago by Jerzy Kosinski. The    Obama candidacy may elevate Kosinksi to one of the most precient    political authors of modern times. After all, what is more Obamesque    than the sort of phrase that got Chance started? - &quot;In the    garden, growth has its seasons. First comes spring and summer,    but then we have fall and winter. And then we get spring and    summer again.&quot;</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Of course, there are differences    between Obama and Chance. Obama does have a modest political    record and he is intelligent where Chance was dense. But the    dynamics of his unprecedented rise has painfully similarities,    especially in the willingness of the public and the media to    turn the corny platitudes into evidence of a Second Coming.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">At a time of economic disjunction,    enormous military failure, a national reputation on the skids    and massive political corruption, it is not hard to see why the    unwary should be attracted to one whose name in Swahili means    &quot;one who is blessed.&quot;</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">This illusion is aided by a media    that has, to a major degree, given up covering facts in political    campaigns in favor a deconstruction of images, rhetoric and sensations.    One of the results is what candidates pretend to be becomes infinitely    more important than what they actually are.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Thus the media has all but ignored    the long list of scandals in Hillary Clinton's past in favor    of such things as positive coverage of how she cynically responds    to mention of her husband's impeachment.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Obama is playing this same card    for all its worth. He knows full well that the presidency is    not about the &quot;audacity of hope&quot; and that, even if    it were, he has no right to control its downloads as though he    was the CEO of the RIAA of optimism.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Obama is engaged in a sophisticated    con with a long history in this country. We normally associated    it with evangelicals - the Elmer Gantrys and the Jerry Falwells    - but the scam can be used by liberals as well. Born-again liberals    can turn their backs on reality as well as any conservative,    finding solace in the comforting chicken soup of faith and hope.    The problem, of course, is that reality just keeps truckin' along    and Americans need far more than cliches to get them through    the next few years.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">While Obama is clearly being intellectually    dishonest, this is, to be sure, a lesser sin than the congenital    variety practiced by his leading opponent. The little available    evidence suggests that Obama would more likely be a disappointment    than a disgrace. Still in the end it's a sad choice between the    venal and the vacuum.</FONT></P>    <P><A NAME="attractsright"></A><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">WHY    OBAMA ATTRACTS THE RIGHT</FONT></B></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">SAM SMITH - Harry Truman remarked    that whenever anyone said they were bipartisan he knew they were    going to vote against him. Barrack Obama is the latest major    politician to use this ploy, promising mushy abstractions instead    of actual policies, making nice to everyone in the room while    ducking the issues they raise and, in a time of historic confrontation    over whether America can recover its constitutional democracy,    pretending that the answer is somewhere in the middle.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">But what is the middle ground between    democracy and fascism? Between having a job or a house or being    unemployed or homeless? Between having health care or dying?</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">As William Lloyd Garrison put it,    &quot;Tell a man whose house is on fire to give moderate alarm;    tel1 him to moderately rescue his wife from the hands of the    ravisher; tell the mother to gradually extricate her babe from    the fire into which it has fallen.&quot;</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">The myth of the happy center is    a major illusion dominating public life in Washington. But the    truth is that from that internecine struggle of two factions    of the American middle known as the Civil War to FBI assaults    on activist organizations in the 60s and 70s, from the Palmer    raids to anti-terrorism legislation, Americans have traditionally    had more to fear from people they have elected than from those    on the fringes of politics. In fact, the latter have often served    largely as an excuse for the American center to tighten its grip    on the political and economic system. This is not to say that    the left and the right would not enjoy being just as violent    and repressive given the chance, but the American center has    rarely allowed that.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Even the KKK, so often cited as    an example of the sort of threat the non-center poses, was powerful    primarily because it was at the center, holding political and    judicial and law enforcement office as well as hiding beneath    its robes. In some towns, lynching parties were even announced    in the local paper. And in the 1920s, both the Colorado governor    and mayor of Denver were members of the Klan, the latter well    enough regarded to have had Stapleton airport named after him.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">The centrist myth most dramatically    fails when those acting upon it dramatically fail. What is the    center on Iraq? On climate change? On the creeping coup taking    over America? On the monopolization of the marketplace?</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">A 10,000 word piece in the New Yorker    - purveyor of the appropriate to the liberal elite - features    Obama as the &quot;conciliator&quot; with hardly a solid program    or policy mentioned. The message of the article - like Obama's    - is that we don't need a president, just a therapist.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Take healthcare for example:</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">&quot;'We've got to put more money    in prevention,' he said. &quot;It makes no sense for children    to be going to the emergency room for treatable ailments like    asthma. Twenty per cent of our patients who have chronic illnesses    account for eighty per cent of the costs, so it's absolutely    critical that we invest in managing those with chronic illnesses    like diabetes. If we hire a case manager to work with them to    insure that they're taking the proper treatments, then potentially    we're not going to have to spend thirty thousand dollars on a    leg amputation.' A young man asked about health care for minorities.    'Obesity and diabetes in minority communities are more severe,'    Obama said, &quot;so I think we need targeted programs, particularly    to children in those communities, to make sure that they've got    sound nutrition, that they have access to fruits and vegetables    and not just Popeyes, and that they have decent spaces to play    in instead of being cooped up in the house all day.'&quot;</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">So just eat your vegetables and    stay away from Popeyes and all will be fine.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Pressed on the matter, Obama does    go a little deeper:</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">&quot;'If you're starting from scratch,&quot;    he says, 'then a single-payer system' -a government-managed system    like Canada's, which disconnects health insurance from employment-    'would probably make sense. But we've got all these legacy systems    in place, and managing the transition, as well as adjusting the    culture to a different system, would be difficult to pull off.    So we may need a system that's not so disruptive that people    feel like suddenly what they've known for most of their lives    is thrown by the wayside.'&quot;</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Since ordinary people could adapt,    say, to the expansion of the Medicare system in a matter of days,    who are these people of whom Obama speaks who might &quot;feel    like suddenly what they've known for most of their lives is thrown    by the wayside?&quot; Well, the insurance companies would be    the ones most affected, and Obama has just sent a clear if covert    signal that he won't be messing with them.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">The right understands the centrist    myth far better than liberals. They know that the center is homeland    security for inaction in public, lots of action behind the scenes,    and power staying where it should: with the powerful. It's not    surprising that some of them see Obama as their man, the &quot;black    Reagan&quot; as he has been called.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Yet he is also the liberals' Pat    Robertson, and while the right can see where they can cut deals    with him, the liberal evangelicals are all misty eyed by his    talk of hope and faith. But Harry Truman was right: that guy    serving you the happy meals of centrism in the campaign is likely    going to be on the other side after election day.</FONT></P>    <P><A HREF="http://zmagsite.zmag.org/Feb2007/street0207.html"><B><FONT     SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">A FEW THINGS TO FORGET ABOUT WHEN    SUPPORTING OBAMA</FONT></B></A></P>    <P><A HREF="http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=3094"><B><FONT     SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">WHY THE MEDIA IS PUSHING OBAMA</FONT></B></A></P>    <P><B><FONT SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">OBAMA: IMPERIALIST    IN DOVE'S CLOTHING</FONT></B></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">[Mind you, this isn't an attack.

No one speaks of the &quot;free world&quot;    these days, and Obama's insistence that we not &quot;cede our    claim of leadership in world affairs&quot; will sound like an    anachronistic conceit to many Europeans, who even in the 1990s    complained about the bullying &quot;hyperpower.&quot; In Moscow    and Beijing it will confirm suspicions about America's inherent    hegemonism. But Obama believes the world yearns to follow us,    if only we restore our worthiness to lead. . .</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">His critique is not that we've meddled    too much but that we haven't meddled enough. There is more to    building democracy than &quot;deposing a dictator and setting    up a ballot box.&quot; We must build societies with &quot;a strong    legislature, an independent judiciary, the rule of law, a vibrant    civil society, a free press, and an honest police force.&quot;    We must build up &quot;the capacity of the world's weakest states&quot;    and provide them &quot;what they need to reduce poverty, build    healthy and educated communities, develop markets, . . . generate    wealth . . . fight terrorism . . . halt the proliferation of    deadly weapons&quot; and fight disease.

Although    less bizarre than Hillary Clinton's 1990s health plan, there    is no justification for it other than pure political convenience.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">If this is the best he can come    up with, there's good reason he's taken the easy way out and    applied the marketing principles of Tony Robbins and Marianne    Williamson to a political campaign. Having gone through eight    years of EST with Bill Clinton and almost that much of AA with    George Bush, we should be burned out on psycho-therapeutics as    opposed to physical reality but sadly many are taken in by Obama's    covert message that if you trust in hope you don't have to worry    about the details like pensions and healthcare.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">There are several problems with    this.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">One is that no one has presented    the slightest evidence of why Obama's hope and faith is better    than that of any of the other candidates.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">The second problem is that hope    is not audacious at all. Audacious would be doing something now,    audacious would be taking a personal political risk because the    country needs it, audacious would be saying something unconventional    because the conventional is killing us. Audacity is not turning    one's back on present needs and praying that the future will    straighten it all out.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">One of the best kept secrets in    America today is the extent to which hope and faith are being    used as seedy substitutes for action and reason. Too often, hope    is a form of postponement and faith a substitute for action or    facing the truth.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">But as they say in the 'hood, hope    don't pay the cable.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">And as Tijn Touber has noted, &quot;If    you hang on to hope, you'll always have to wait&quot; and &quot;waiting    makes you passive.&quot;</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Thus, someone like Obama functions    as a political sedative. His message is that we don't have to    worry so much about what's happening because we can let the future    handle it.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">This is not audacious; it's either    a con or cowardice.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow"><BR>    <B>APRIL 2007</B></FONT></P>    <P><A HREF="http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/353829%2CCST-NWS-rez23.article"><B><FONT     SIZE="+1" FACE="Arial Narrow">OBAMA WORKED FOR LAW FIRM TIED    TO DUBIOUS LANDLORD</FONT></B></A></P>    <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">HIDDEN TRUTHS ABOUT OBAMA</FONT></B></P>    <P><B><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">KEN SILVERSTEIN, HARPER'S -</FONT></B><FONT     FACE="Arial Narrow"> Since announcing his candidacy for the    Illinois Senate seat, Obama has raised the astonishing sum of    nearly $21 million and has built close relationships with a number    of traditional fat-cat donors. For example, one of Obama's leading    career patrons is Skadden, Arps ($53,271, according to the most    recent disclosure filings), a leading corporate law firm and    one of the biggest donors to the Democratic Party.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">Several of the firm's lawyers donated    money to Obama and also helped raise money for him as well. That    includes Christina Tchen, a corporate litigator at Skadden who    has represented major financial firms in consumer class-action    suits. . .</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">In November of last year, three    other Skadden attorneys helped organize a fundraiser for Obama's    Leadership PAC, the vehicle he uses to support other Democratic    candidates, and to boost his own political profile and gain support    within the party. . . Others who have helped raise funds for    Obama's Leadership PAC include John Gorman of Texas-based Tejas    Securities, a major funder of Senate Democrats (and of the Bush    presidential campaigns) and Winston &amp; Strawn, the Chicago-based    law and lobbying firm. Individual contributors to Obama include    some of the best-connected lobbyists in town, including Jeffrey    Peck (whose clients include MasterCard, the Business Roundtable,    and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce) and Rich Tarplin (Chevron,    the American Petroleum Institute, and the National Association    of Manufacturers).</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">In the magazine article, I asserted    that Obama is not a mouthpiece for his donors; neither does his    voting record mirrors the wishes of his contributor list. But,    as I suggested, it's naive to think that he's completely unaware    of who's footing the bills. Exelon, a leading nuclear-plant operator    based in Illinois, is a big donor to Obama, and its executive    and employees have given him more than $70,000 since 2004. The    Obama staffer pointed out that the senator pushed for legislation    that would require nuclear companies to &quot;inform state and    local officials if there is an accidental or unintentional leak    of a radioactive substance,&quot; according to an office press    release. Obama took a stand on that issue following reports that    a plant operated by Exelon had leaked tritium several times over    the past decade.</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">But Exelon is probably not entirely    unhappy with Obama. At a 2005 hearing at the Senate Committee    on Environment &amp; Public Works, of which Obama is a member,    the senator-echoing the nuclear industry's current campaign to    promotes nuclear energy as &quot;green&quot; - said that since    Congress was debating &quot;policies to address air quality and    the deleterious effects of carbon emissions on the global ecosystem,    it is reasonable - and realistic - for nuclear power to remain    on the table for consideration.&quot; He was immediately lauded    by the industry publication Nuclear Notes, which said, &quot;Back    during his campaign for the U.S. Senate in 2004, [Obama] said    that he rejected both liberal and conservative labels in favor    of 'common sense solutions.' And when it comes to nuclear energy,    it seems like the Senator is keeping an open mind.&quot;</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">To anyone who thinks Obama is blissfully    oblivious to the fundraising imperative, consider the following:    in one of his earliest votes as a senator, Obama helped pass    a class-action &quot;reform&quot; bill that was a long-standing    and cherished goal of business groups. (The bill was the focus    of a significant lobbying effort by financial firms, who constitute    Obama's second-biggest single bloc of donors.). . .</FONT></P>    <P><FONT FACE="Arial Narrow">http://www.harpers.org/sb-a-little-bit-more-on-obama-1161881683.html</FONT></P>    <P><A HREF="http://prorev.com/obama2.htm"><B><FONT SIZE="+1"     FACE="Arial">EARLIER STORIES</FONT></B></A></TD>   </TR></TABLE></TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="50%">&nbsp;</TD> <TD WIDTH="50%">&nbsp;</TD></TR><TR><TD WIDTH="50%">&nbsp;</TD> <TD WIDTH="50%">&nbsp;</TD></TR></TABLE></CENTER></BODY></HTML>
