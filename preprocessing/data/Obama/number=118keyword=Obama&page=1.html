Yet, in the lead-up to the 2014 midterm elections, candidates have barely brought immigration reform to the debate table. \n\nInstead, the war of rhetoric between Republicans and Democrats has been waged over other longstanding issues, such as job growth and healthcare reform, as well as issues of the moment, including how to contain Ebola and combat Islamic State extremists who are taking over large swaths of Iraq and Syria. \n\nSee also: The Midterm Elections Are Worth Your Attention. Here's Why\n\nThis reality is odd, given the attention surrounding U.S. President Barack Obama's ever-evolving pledges to reform immigration policy, the country's growing Latino population, the constant political back-and-forth over \"border security\" and the fact that the Senate passed a major immigration overhaul just last year only to watch the House of Representatives decide to overlook the bill. One would think candidates would at least be holding debates about the issue.  \n\nBut Democrats have put down their immigration swords for the 2014 midterms, deeming the issue a lost cause this year, according to Elaine Kamarck, senior governance studies fellow at the Brookings Institution, a bipartisan think tank. Voters during midterms tend to be older and whiter, groups that are not commonly associated with being gung-ho about immigration reform, Kamarck told Mashable. The Democratic Party also made a clear decision not to raise the issue after primaries because it \"would hurt vulnerable Democrats,\" she said. \n\nRepublicans haven't picked up swords of their own, because doing so might invite criticism no matter what stance they took, Ari Ratner, a fellow at the New America Foundation, told Mashable. If they push for reform, the party's more conservative elements may stop supporting them. If they don't, their voters may lash out at the polls. \n\nAfter consistently fighting throughout 2013, both parties seem to have called a truce on immigration policy until the midterms play out, as the Democrats and Republicans seem too wary of the issue's contentiousness to risk possible damage to their election hopes. \n\nJust about the only way in which politicians did bring up immigration reform after the primaries was through a backdoor of sorts. Republican candidates (and this was, in fact, limited to Republican candidates) from North Carolina Rep. Thom Tillis to Arkansas Rep. Tom Cotton to New Hampshire's Scott Brown have tried to rally support for increasing security along the U.S.-Mexico border by trying to stoke fears that ISIS militants and people infected with Ebola might slip through America's southern border, an argument that Ratner is not fond of. \n\n\u201cEbola is a serious issue. Ebola coming from Mexico to America is not a serious issue. ISIS coming to America from Mexico is not a serious issue,\" Ratner, who has worked for president Obama, told Mashable. \u201cIt\u2019s a deeply syndical, deeply misleading, deeply harmful and frankly disgraceful way to talk about very, very serious issues.\u201d\n\nCandidates only discussed the issue directly during primaries, according to a Brookings report. Immigration reform was discussed about as much as taxes, and the two topics were second only to healthcare. The problem is that most candidates from both parties discussed immigration down staunch party lines, as shown in the chart, below. \n\nThat could very well be a bad thing for the near future, according to the report. \n\n\"There are some slivers of hope for a more robust discussion of health care on the Democratic side and of immigration on the Republican side, but we should not overemphasize these conclusions,\" the report stated. \"The fact is that on the two big issues of the 2014 primaries, the political parties are as polarized as ever.\" \n\nThat doesn't bode well for progress in the near term, and Ratner said that immigration reform will be \"deeply stalled\" if the Republican Party takes over the Senate after midterms are over. Yet he also said that a prominent Republican, such as Florida Sen. Marco Rubio or Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, could take the party in a different direction. \n\nStill, Kamarck said the parties are at a \"profound impasse\" on the issue. \n\n\"There's not a sort of easy compromise on this one,\" Kamarck said. \n\nHave something to add to this story?

The sitting president is generally one of those people, but most of them are wrinkly old white dudes with loads of cash. \n\nAll their money usually funds a bunch of the campaign ads that invade televisions around this time every voting season and cause viewers to groan and traipse to the fridge during commercial breaks. \n\nSee also: The Midterm Elections Are Worth Your Attention. Here's Why\n\nThe money and ideology of a few has a greatly outsized impact on how U.S. politics play out, so we figured we'd spotlight just a few of the folks who are the biggest non-candidate players in this year's midterms. \n\nThe Koch brothers\n\nFirst of all, it's pronounced \"Coke,\" just so you're not distracted while reading through this. \n\nSo there are four brothers: Fred, Bill, Charles and David. But the ones you need to know here are Charles and David, as they control Koch Industries, the second largest privately-held company in the country, with its corporate hands in just about every industry you can name. \n\nMost massive business enterprises generate a lot of cash, and Koch Industries is no different. Charles and David have used that cash to start political donation groups such as the Super PAC Freedom Partners Action Fund (Super PACs are basically organizations that collect lots of money for political use) and they donate eye-popping sums of money to Republican and libertarian candidates and causes in various elections. \n\nIn 2014, they're likely to spend as much as $290 million through a web of groups and offshoot organizations that make much of their money very hard to track. \n\nBut 2014 candidates we know have received significant Koch contributions include Senate hopeful Arkansas Rep. Tom Cotton, Senate hopeful Colorado Rep. Cory Gardner and Senate hopeful Iowa state Sen. Joni Ernst. They've all said they would likely not be in position to win their respective elections were it not for Koch money. \n\nTom Steyer\n\nIf Steyer had a superhero alter-ego, it might be Captain Planet. But, if he had a villain alter-ego, he might be named Secret Carbon Pollution Man. \n\nSteyer's a complicated guy.\n\nHe's the former manager of the hedge fund Farallon Capital Management, and he's got loads of cash. He's put $74 million of his own money into the 2014 midterms, helping candidates who support various measures that battle climate change. Steyer's Super PAC, NextGen Climate Action Committee, has reportedly spent more money on this year's election than any other group (though let's remember that Koch brother money is hard to track, and $290 million is greater than $74 million). \n\nAll that makes Steyer sound like Mr. Going Green, but the fund he used to lead (and in which he is still an investor) has continued to invest in mines outside the U.S. that will produce millions of tons of carbon pollution for decades to come. Steyer has said he will sell his fossil fuel holdings, but his aides reportedly declined to say whether he has asked Farallon to do the same. \n\nUnlike the Koch brothers, Steyer is pretty clear about where he puts his money. He's poured his wealth into trying to defeat Republican Florida Gov. Rick Scott's reelection attempt, into trying to reelect Colorado Sen. Mark Udall and several other races where one candidate's support of initiatives to fight climate change is much greater than the other's. In many of those races, he's found that his money is simply balancing out cash from the Koch brothers. \n\nBarack Obama\n\nDemocrats have been running from Obama like they're high school students and he's a former homecoming king caught cheating on his girlfriend at prom. Are you friends with Obama? No, I wouldn't say that. Did you vote for him? Um, I'd rather not say. Do you support his policies? Uhhh..\n\nSeriously, though, the president's dismal approval rating has had a huge impact on midterm races, as Republicans try to paint their Democratic opponents as Obama-lovers, while those same Democrats try to cast themselves as rogue individualist politicians who are just too cool to take top-down orders from the White House. \n\nDemocratic Alaska Sen. Mark Begich has called himself a \"total thorn\" in Obama's side and said the president is \"irrelevant\" right after Begich admitted he voted for the guy. Which is more than can be said for Democratic Kentucky Senate candidate Alison Lundergan Grimes, who on multiple occasions has (in)famously refused to answer whether she's ever voted for Obama. She will tell you that she was a Hillary Clinton 2008 supporter, though. \n\nAnd Arkansas Democratic Sen. Mark Pryor, when asked whether the Obama administration had done a good job responding to Ebola in the U.S., replied with pretty much nothing more than one long \"Uhhhhhhh...\" \n\nSo it's clear that the president is affecting elections in a big way, just not in the way that he or his fellow Democrats had probably hoped. \n\nMichael Bloomberg\n\nRemember this guy?\n\nThe Republican-turned-independent former mayor of New York City has so far donated some $20 million to causes related to this election season, making him the second-biggest 2014 donor by traditional means of donation (which, again, doesn't include the Koch brothers). \n\nBloomberg has dumped buckets of money into local elections (as have those Koch brothers) that would otherwise remain obscure. One of the best examples of that is his recent infusion of around $200,000 into the race for Milwaukee County sheriff, where Bloomberg wants to kick out the pro-gun incumbent. He's been a significant donor for advocates of gun control and education reform for years now, and, this season, 90% of his money has so far gone to Democrats. Bloomberg has often found himself trying to provide a counterweight to money that the National Rifle Association gives to pro-gun candidates and causes. \n\nLeaders of the Christian right\n\nRalph Reed Jr., founder of the Faith and Freedom Coalition, isn't about marshaling money for political causes so much as directly marshaling voters via phone calls. \n\nHis socially conservative group, the Faith and Freedom Coalition, wants to have made 10 million phone calls to constituents mainly in Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Iowa, Kentucky and North Carolina by Nov. 4, as those are swing states that the Republican Party will need to win if it wants to take control of the Senate. \n\nFaith and Freedom Coalition, along with a few other Republican religious leaders, tap into the breadth of evangelical Christians, the vast majority of whom vote for GOP causes and candidates. They tend to turn out in large numbers for midterm elections, giving the group an outsized political weight compared with other segments of the population. \n\nRepublican candidates have largely backed away from evangelical causes this year such as anti-abortion and anti-same-sex marriage legislation, likely because they wanted to cast a more moderate image to win votes in tight races, but evangelical constituents have reportedly proven loyal to the Republican Party over the years, and a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll showed that 49% of evangelicals are heavily invested in this year's midterm elections, compared with just 38% of non-evangelicals. \n\nRepublican candidates be warned, though: A recent Pew survey found that around one third of white, evangelical Republicans say the party has not been conservative enough on social issues. \n\nHave something to add to this story?

Everybody here has to do more.\"\n\nObama said that stopping the Ebola outbreak is in the interest of all countries, in part because of the risk that the virus could breed regional instability or even spread beyond West Africa. \"... in an era where regional crises can quickly become global threats, stopping Ebola is in the interest of all of us,\" he said.\n\nIn a new report released Thursday morning, the WHO said the ebola outbreak is still getting worse, despite statistics that seem to show a recent drop in the number of cases and deaths. \n\n\"The epidemic of EVD in West Africa is still increasing,\" the WHO said.\n\nWHO Director-General Margaret Chan told the dignitaries gathered at the meeting that the virus is still running well ahead of efforts to control it.  \u201cThis is a fast-moving epidemic that got ahead of everyone from the start\u2026 and is still running ahead, jumping over\u201d obstacles put in its way, she said. \n\nAs an example of the delayed response effort, data published by her agency has shown that the virus was spreading in Guinea for three months before it was detected.\n\n\u201cWe need to act with speed and efficiency and in ways that deal this virus some heavy blows,\u201d Chan said.\n\nThe U.S. has mobilized personnel from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and established a military command in Liberia to support response efforts in West Africa, and other nations including Cuba and China have also contributed aid. \n\nHowever, Obama acknowledged these steps and others won't be enough to gain the upper hand against a brutally efficient killer that has wiped out entire families and taken advantage of the high population density in the cities of Sierra Leone and Liberia in order to spread from one person to the next. \n\n\"I hope that I'm properly communicating a sense of urgency here,\" Obama said. \"Do not stand by, thinking that somehow, because of what we've done, that it's taken care of. It's not. And if we don't take care of this now we are going to see fallout effects and secondary effects from this that will have ramifications for a long time, above and beyond the lives that will have been lost.\"\n\n According to the latest WHO data, the number of confirmed cases in Liberia appears to have fallen in the past week, but that is likely due to erroneous data. \"It is likely that the figures will be revised upwards in due course,\" the Ebola virus disease status report says.\n\nThe WHO says the situation in Sierra Leone also continues to \"deteriorate,\" largely driven by an increase in cases in the capital, Freetown.\n\nThe U.N. agency has said that failing to bring this outbreak under control soon could result in the disease becoming endemic in West Africa, which had not been contemplated before by public health officials. \n\nThe CDC meanwhile, released a study on Sept. 23 that projects the future spread of the deadly virus, after making assumptions for the number of cases and doubling rate for the number of infected persons. The study's worst-case scenario projected up to 1.4 million people infected with the deadly virus by the end of January 2015, although there is a large amount of uncertainty in such projections.\n\nAccording to the World Bank, such an outcome would be disastrous for the fragile economies in this region, costing nearly 12% of Liberia's annual GDP, for example. \n\nIn an interview with Mashable on Sept. 22, World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim said progress is being made in fighting the outbreak, but it remains to be seen if the international community can rein it in. \n\n\"This is gonna cost a lot, but it's gonna cost way way more if we don't respond immediately,\" he said. \"Right now, we've gotta move, because the outbreak is doubling every few weeks.\""},"shares":{"twitter":513,"facebook":38,"linked_in":10,"google_plus":5,"total":566},"comments_count":0,"image":"http://rack.1.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA5LzI1LzJkL29iYW1hX2Vib2xhLjdjOWVkLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTk1MHg1MzQjCmUJanBn/bf2a44a9/235/obama_ebola_un.jpg","feature_image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA5LzI1LzJkL29iYW1hX2Vib2xhLjdjOWVkLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTE0Mzh4CmUJanBn/0484fc76/235/obama_ebola_un.jpg","responsive_images":[{"image":"http://rack.3.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA5LzI1LzJkL29iYW1hX2Vib2xhLjdjOWVkLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTIwMHgxMTUjCmUJanBn/c5666c83/235/obama_ebola_un.jpg","query":true,"size":"200x115#"},{"image":"http://rack.0.mshcdn.com/media/ZgkyMDE0LzA5LzI1LzJkL29iYW1hX2Vib2xhLjdjOWVkLmpwZwpwCXRodW1iCTQwMHgyMzAjCmUJanBn/e7e56328/235/obama_ebola_un.jpg","query":"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)","size":"400x230#"}],"short_url":"http://on.mash.to/1qzdJrd","choice":false,"spotlight":false,"shortcode_data":{"see_also":[{"data-url":"http://mashable.com/2014/09/19/sierra-leone-ebola-lockdown-2/"}]},"excerpt":"President Obama delivered a stark warning to world leaders that there is a high risk that the Ebola virus will continue to ravage West Africa unless more actions are taken soon to slow and stop the outbreak.

Bush in 2009, Obama is expanding it to six times its existing size. This protects an additional 490,000 square miles of ocean waters in and around tropical islands and atolls, including Wake Island, Johnson Atoll, Jarvis Island and others in the south-central Pacific Ocean -- one of the most pristine ocean environments under U.S. control. That's about the same size as the states of Texas, New Mexico and Oklahoma combined.\n\nObama's action also roughly doubles the amount of marine protected areas worldwide.\n\nSee also: The Oceans May Get Too Acidic for Sharks to Smell Their Food\n\n\"Expanding the Monument will more fully protect the deep coral reefs, seamounts and marine ecosystems unique to this part of the world, which are also among the most vulnerable areas to the impacts of climate change and ocean acidification,\" according to a White House fact sheet.\n\nFrom overfishing to climate change, the world's oceans are under assault from a wide array of manmade threats that are altering the chemistry of ocean waters; they are becoming more acidic, which harms corals and shellfish. The acidity of the ocean is changing 50 times faster than any known change in millions of years, according to data cited by the White House.\n\nThe expanded monument will include more than 130 sea mounts, which are underwater mountains that are often volcanic, and home to previously undiscovered species. The monument area will also encompass more migration routes of species, including sea turtles, tuna, sharks, marine mammals and manta rays. In addition, foraging seabirds can be found in the protected areas, including red-footed boobies and sooty terns.\n\nWhile commercial fishing will be off limits in the expanded monument, \"recreational and traditional fishing that is consistent with the conservation goals\" will be permitted.\n\nOcean advocates, who are racing against the clock in an effort to protect hotspots of biodiversity worldwide before human activities further degrade the health of ocean ecosystems, praised Obama's actions.\n\n\"This marks and important day for ocean conservation in this country,\" said Matt Rand of the Pew Charitable Trust's Global Ocean Legacy Project. \"The expansion of these marine reserves will greatly enhance the footprint of protection already there and with it, support a vast array of sea life that inhabits on of the most pristine ocean systems remaining on earth.\"\n\nEnvironmental advocacy group Avaaz also applauded the monument designation, and called on other countries to follow suit in waters under their jurisdiction.\n\n\u201cPresident Obama\u2019s announcement delivers a ray of hope in the battle to save our seas which are gasping for help. To stop the industrial trawlers, other governments and international bodies must urgently follow suit and create more marine sanctuaries so that our fishing stocks and marine life recovers,\" said Luis Morago, Avaaz campaign director.\n\nPresidents have used their executive authority to designate national monuments since 1906, when former U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt established the Devils Tower National Monument in Wyoming.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

Beat ISIS\n2. Reject extremism\n3. Address sectarian conflict\n4. Arab countries must support the youth.\n\n#UNGA\u2014 MashableLIVE (@MashableLive) September 24, 2014\n\nThe most visible aspect of the fight against ISIS militants has been the U.S.-led coalition of nations around the world and its local allies on the ground who have been battling the extremists with everything from airstrikes to military aid. \n\nThe U.S., Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates bombed Islamic State targets in Syria on Monday, while Qatar provided non-lethal support. American jets also blasted an al-Qaeda affiliate known as the Khorasan group which was believed to be in the final stages of carrying out an attack on a western target. \n\nISIS militants control territory from northern Syria through western Iraq and are trying to establish a de-facto nation whose fighting force has grown with its success and an aggressive recruitment campaign across social media platforms. \n\nObama reiterated the need to combat ISIS's vision of the world. There should be no notion of an \"us versus them\" fight, he said, because many millions of Muslims call the United States home, and much of the Muslim world has spoken out against the \"perverted\" notion of Islam that ISIS has used to promote its bloody agenda.\n\n\"You come from a great tradition that stands for education, not ignorance; innovation, not destruction; the dignity of life, not murder,\" Obama said, directing his comments at young Muslims. \"Those who call you away from this path are betraying this tradition, not defending it.\"\n\nThough the president has outlined his strategy to combat ISIS many times over the past several months, this was his most impassioned and comprehensive speech yet, as he addressed not just military options but spoke at length on the ideological differences between ISIS and the rest of the world. \n\n\"Ultimately, the task of rejecting sectarianism and extremism is a generational task \u2013 a task for the people of the Middle East themselves,\" Obama said. \"No external power can bring about a transformation of hearts and minds. But America will be a respectful and constructive partner. We will neither tolerate terrorist safe-havens, nor act as an occupying power.\"\n\n\"I can promise you America will remain engaged in the region, and we are prepared to engage in that effort,\u201d Obama says of the Middle East.\u2014 MashableLIVE (@MashableLive) September 24, 2014\n\nIn a speech that largely tried to portray the U.S. as a partner to global progress, Obama said he understands that America has not always lived up to the its own ideals, but that it \"welcomes the scrutiny of the world\" and he is proud of the nation's progress. The promise that citizens have the means to change their own society, Obama said, is what drives America. \n\n\"After nearly six years as President,\" Obama said, \"I believe that this promise can help light the world.\"\n\nHave something to add to this story?

After weeks of launching strikes against militant targets in Iraq, Obama extended the military action into Syria on Monday, joined by an unexpected coalition of five Arab nations. Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the United Arab Emirates joined the U.S. in carrying out airstrikes, while Qatar played a supporting role.\n\nSee also: Video Shows U.S. Navy Launching Missiles Against ISIS in Syria\n\nThe partnership with Arab countries marked a rare victory for Obama during a tough stretch in which his foreign policy has been challenged not only by the Middle East militants, but also Russia's provocations in Ukraine and an Ebola outbreak in West Africa.\n\nOfficials said Obama will also address ways the U.S. has sought to mobilize international action to resolve the Ukraine and Ebola crises as well, including getting deepening economic sanctions on Russia and dispatching 3,000 U.S. troops to West Africa to help deal with the Ebola outbreak.\n\nBut the growing U.S. military role in the Middle East will be the centerpiece of the president's sixth address to the U.N. General Assembly. It comes at a time when Obama had hoped to be nearing the end of the second of the two wars he inherited in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n\nInstead, the U.S. is plunging back into military action in Iraq, as well as Syria, where Obama long has tried to avoid involvement in a bloody civil war now in its fourth year. The airstrikes were aimed at not only Islamic State targets but also a new al-Qaida cell that the Pentagon said was nearing the \"execution phase\" of a direct attack on the U.S. or Europe.\n\nObama will also hold his first one-on-one meeting Wednesday with new Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi, who took office earlier this year.\n\nLater Wednesday, the president will convene an unusual meeting of the U.N. Security Council, during which members were expected to adopt a resolution that would require all countries to prevent the recruitment and transport of would-be foreign fighters preparing to join terrorist groups such as the Islamic State group.\n\nHowever, Obama administration officials have acknowledged that U.N. resolutions can be notoriously difficult to enforce.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

The strikes targeted ISIS \"fighters, training compounds, headquarters and command and control facilities, storage facilities, a finance center, supply trucks and armed vehicles,\" according to the Pentagon. \n\nSee also: Muslims Launch Powerful Social Media Campaign Against ISIS With #NotInMyName\n\n\"It must be clear to anyone who would plot against America and try to do Americans harm, that we will not tolerate safe havens for terrorists who threaten our people,\" Obama said, confirming strikes against another militant group known as the Khorasan group. \n\nThe strikes are the first ones to be carried out in Syria, and follow a series of attacks against the Islamic State in Iraq. \n\nAs part of the operation, U.S. fighter jets and drones conducted eight strikes west of Aleppo, Syria, against the Khorasan group, an al-Qaeda-affiliated militant group who is reportedly focused on attacking the West, the Pentagon said. The Khorasan group was first mentioned by Director of National Intelligence James Clapper during an intelligence conference in Washington on Thursday. \n\n\"In terms of threat to the homeland, Khorasan may pose as much of a danger as the Islamic State,\" Clapper said at the time.\n\nWith the strikes, the U.S. disrupted the group's \"imminent attack plotting against the United States and Western interests,\" the Pentagon said. \n\nObama also underlined that the strikes against ISIS were carried out alongside a \"broad coalition,\", according to Obama -- including Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates (UAE), Jordan, Bahrain and Qatar.\n\n\"The strength of this coalition makes it clear to the world that this is not America's fight alone,\" Obama said.\n\nThe U.S. informed the Syrian government of these operations in advance, said Jen Psaki, a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department. Samantha Power, the U.S. ambassador to the U.N., gave that notice to the Syrian Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Psaki said.\n\n\"We warned Syria not to engage U.S. aircraft. We did not request the regime's permission,\" Psaki said in a statement. \"We did not coordinate our actions with the Syrian government. We did not provide advance notification to the Syrians at a military level, or give any indication of our timing on specific targets.\"\n\nThe Syrian government acknowledged that it received notification with a statement released by Syrian state media on Tuesday, although the statement did not clarify whether the regime led by Syrian President Bashar al-Assad approved of the strikes.\n\nObama's speech came just hours before the President was scheduled to travel to New York City to lead a United Nations Security Council meeting, where the U.S. hopes to pass a binding resolution asking countries to block the flow of foreign fighters to militant groups like ISIS. \n\nUPDATE, Sept. 23, 11:57 a.m. ET:  U.N.

General Assembly, Obama will also speak at a meeting about Ebola, chaired by U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, where individual nations and the U.N. will announce new commitments to fight the outbreak in West Africa. Obama this week ordered 3,000 U.S. military personnel to the region to deal with the outbreak, and the U.S. is expecting other countries on Thursday to offer money, equipment and personnel, plus pledges to build treatment units for Ebola victims.\n\nSee also: Obama Says No U.S. Ground War Against ISIS But 'Mission Creep' Looms\n\nTopping the international community's agenda as world leaders gather in New York is the threat posed by ISIS extremists who have seized about one-third of Syria and Iraq. Obama is working to form a global coalition to confront the group, but many leaders in both the West and the Arab world have been reluctant to involve themselves publicly in the U.S.-led military effort.\n\nObama's national security adviser, Susan Rice, said she expects unanimous approval in the U.N. Security Council for a resolution obligating member states to \"prevent and deter\" their citizens from traveling to war zones to join extremist groups. The resolution falls under Chapter 7 of the U.N. Charter, meaning it can be enforced militarily.\n\nAlthough the resolution doesn't authorize the U.S. military campaign against the Islamic State group, it could bolster the president's argument that there's broad international support for the effort. The White House has said it has the authority under existing U.S. law to carry out airstrikes in Syria but hasn't offered an explicit legal justification under international law.\n\n\"It will move the ball down the field in terms of the international legal architecture and obligations on states to try to combat this challenge,\" Rice said of the resolution.\n\nWhile in New York, Obama on Tuesday will attend a U.N. summit on climate change aimed at building support for a global climate treaty to be finalized next year in Paris. He'll also discuss the need to strengthen civil society across the globe when he addresses the annual meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative.\n\nObama also plans a series of bilateral meetings with foreign leaders on the sidelines of the U.N.

For one thing, there are already 1,600 Americans on the ground in Iraq. While not there to conduct offensive missions against the Islamic State, the Americans are authorized to use force if attacked. \n\nAnd not all military officials have taken the stance that ground forces are out of the question. Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, this week testified before the Senate Armed Forces Committee that if the current plan to battle ISIS fails, he could \"go back to the president and make a recommendation that may include the use of U.S. military ground forces.\u201d\n\nSo how to reconcile what Obama has said with Dempsey's testimony? They're not actually that far apart, observers say. \n\n\"I do think that the president will not allow a large number of troops to be engaged unless something truly catastrophic happened on the ground,\" Michael Noonan, an Iraq war veteran and tnational security program director at the Foreign Policy Research Institute, told Mashable. \"The whole notion of 'no boots on the ground' really seems to mean that there will be no large-scale conventional U.S. ground troops involved in the conflict.\"\n\nU.S. officials may authorize a small number of troops to help coordinate airstrikes or plan assaults with Iraqi forces who are close to the front line, Nicholas Heras, a Middle East researcher at the Center for a New American Security, said. \u201cAt this point in time, it\u2019s unclear whether the Iraqi military is able to work with the Kurdish peshmerga...to take the offensive.\" \n\nAs U.S. airstrikes against ISIS continue, the extremists may retreat to cities with a large number of civilians. In that case, Heras said, the U.S. would have to rely on Iraqi forces, Kurdish troops and others to build ties with locals to help root out the radicals. And if that fails, the U.S. will have to come up with other options.\n\nAnd then there are other scenarios, harder to predict. Americans on the ground could be captured or American planes might be shot down. In an event such as either of those, the U.S. mission would likely expand.\n\nIn his speech on Wednesday, Obama emphasized that the battle against ISIS \"will not be America's fight alone.\" But he also made it clear that the U.S. mission could last for an indefinite period of time. \n\n\"If you threaten America, you will find no safe haven,\" Obama said. \"We will find you eventually.\u201d\n\nHave something to add to this story?

A video of his speech (starting at 27:45) is embedded below.\n\nWASHINGTON \u2014 The Obama administration is ramping up its response to West Africa's Ebola crisis, preparing to assign 3,000 U.S. military personnel to the afflicted region to supply medical and logistical support to overwhelmed local health care systems and to boost the number of beds needed to isolate and treat victims of the epidemic.\n\nPresident Barack Obama planned to announce the stepped-up effort Tuesday during a visit to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta amid alarm that the outbreak could spread and that the deadly virus could mutate into a more easily transmitted disease.\n\nSee also: WHO: 'If We Are Going to War With Ebola, We Need the Resources to Fight'\n\nThe new U.S. muscle comes after appeals from the region and from aid organizations for a heightened U.S. role in combatting the outbreak blamed for more than 2,200 deaths.\n\nAdministration officials said Monday that the new initiatives aim to:\n\n\u2014 Train as many as 500 health care workers a week.\n\n\u2014 Erect 17 heath care facilities in the region of 100 beds each.\n\n\u2014 Set up a joint command headquartered in Monrovia, Liberia, to coordinate between U.S. and international relief efforts.\n\n\u2014 Provide home health care kits to hundreds of thousands of households, including 50,000 that the U.S. Agency for International Development will deliver to Liberia this week.\n\n\u2014 Carry out a home- and community-based campaign to train local populations on how to handle exposed patients.\n\n.@WhiteHouse releases fact sheet showing U.S. response to Ebola epidemic in West Africa: pic.twitter.com/YU1jRGypbP\u2014 Oliver Darcy (@oliverdarcy) September 16, 2014\n\nThe officials, speaking on the condition of anonymity to discuss the plans ahead of Obama's announcement, said the cost of the effort would come from $500 million in overseas contingency operations, such as the war in Afghanistan, that the Pentagon already has asked Congress to redirect to carry out humanitarian efforts in Iraq and in West Africa.\n\nThe officials said it would take about two weeks to get U.S. forces on the ground.\n\nSen. Chris Coons, D-Del., the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations African affairs subcommittee, applauded the new U.S. commitment. Coons earlier had called for the Obama administration to step up its role in West Africa.\n\n\"This humanitarian intervention should serve as a firewall against a global security crisis that has the potential to reach American soil,\" he said.\n\nHardest hit by the outbreak are Liberia, Sierra Leone and Guinea. The virus also has reached Nigeria and Senegal. Ebola is spread through direct contact with the bodily fluids of sick patients, making doctors and nurses especially vulnerable to contracting the virus, which has no vaccine or approved treatment.\n\nThe U.S. effort will include medics and corpsmen for treatment and training, engineers to help erect the treatment facilities and specialists in logistics to assist in patient transportation.\n\nObama's trip to the CDC comes a day after the United States also demanded a stepped-up international response to the outbreak. The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, called Monday for an emergency meeting of the U.N. Security Council on Thursday, warning that the potential risk of the virus could \"set the countries of West Africa back a generation.\"\n\nCrucial that\u00a0@UN Security Council\u00a0members begin the process of marshaling our collective resources to stop the spread of #Ebola.\u2014 Samantha Power (@AmbassadorPower) September 16, 2014\n\nPower said the meeting Thursday would mark a rare occasion when the Security Council, which is responsible for threats to international peace and security, addresses a public health crisis.\n\nU.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon was expected to brief the council along with World Health Organization chief Dr. Margaret Chan and Dr. David Nabarro, the recently named U.N. coordinator to tackle the disease, as well as representatives from the affected countries.\n\nWhite House press secretary Josh Earnest, responding to criticism that the U.S. needed a more forceful response to the outbreak, said Monday that Obama has identified the outbreak \"as a top national security priority,\" worried that it could contribute to political instability in the region and that, left unchecked, the virus could transform and become more contagious.\n\nHe said the administration responded \"pretty aggressively\" when the outbreak was first reported in March.\n\n\"Since that time our assistance has steadily been ramping up,\" he said.\n\nThe Senate was also weighing in Tuesday with a hearing to examine the U.S. response. An American missionary doctor who survived the disease was among those scheduled to testify.\n\nFour Americans have been or are being treated for Ebola in the U.S. after evacuation from Africa.\n\nThe U.S. has spent more than $100 million responding to the outbreak and has offered to operate treatment centers for patients.\n\nWhile at the CDC, Obama also will be briefed about cases of respiratory illness being reported in the Midwest, the White House said. Public health officials are monitoring a high number of reported illnesses associated with human enterovirus 68 in Iowa, Kansas, Ohio and elsewhere.\n\nAfter leaving Atlanta, Obama planned to travel to Florida to visit the headquarters of U.S. Central Command in Tampa, where he'll meet with military officials about the U.S. counterterrorism campaign against the Islamic State group. Central Command overseas U.S. military efforts in the Middle East.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

Carbon dioxide, the main long-lived greenhouse gas that is causing global warming, stayed at or above 400 parts per million for several months in 2014 -- the highest it has been in human history. A single molecule of carbon dioxide can remain in the atmosphere for hundreds to a thousand years, which makes the problem particularly challenging to solve.\n\nSee also: This Month's U.N. Climate Summit Will Help Seal the Fate of Nations\n\nChina is sending Vice Premier Zhang Gaoli as a special envoy of President Xi Jinping, according to Xinhua. \"The Chinese side will participate in the summit and related activities in a constructive manner,\" Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying told the state-run media outlet. \"The Chinese side expects to join efforts with the international community to push for positive results in the summit, advance international cooperation on climate change and contribute to addressing climate change.\"\n\nThe U.N. document says leaders will be given speaking slots that are just four minutes long, although Xinhua reported that a \"keynote address\" will be given by China's Zhang, suggesting a longer speaking allotment.\n\nIndia, the third-largest emitter behind the U.S., is sending its environment minister to the meeting instead of newly elected Prime Minister Narendra Modi. However, Modi is traveling to Washington several days after the summit to meet with Obama, and climate change is expected to be one of the issues they discuss.\n\nMany countries, including Australia, Russia, Pakistan and Ukraine will be represented by their foreign ministers, while other nations, such as Canada, are sending their environment ministers. Notably, Saudi Arabia, whose economy depends on its oil exports, is sending its petroleum minister to the environmental meeting.\n\nWith leaders facing a deadline of 2015 to negotiate a new climate agreement that will be enforced in 2020, the summit is seen as a momentum builder ahead of formal negotiations. It will be the largest gathering of world leaders to discuss climate change since the Copenhagen Summit in 2009, and depending on the final guest list, it may even draw more leaders than that meeting.\n\nThe Climate Summit will bring together political leaders, business executives and representatives of nongovernmental organizations. Those involved in the planning say that a series of commitments in the areas of emissions cuts and financial contributions will likely be announced. The announcements will be aimed at increasing the use of renewable energy, increasing energy efficiency, reducing deforestation and promoting climate action in the world's cities, among other goals, according to a release.\n\nHave something to add to this story?

On Thursday, 10 Arab countries and the U.S. signed a communique that commits signatories to contribute military resources \"as appropriate\" in order to \"destroy\" ISIS. It is unclear, however, which of those 10 countries would provide military assistance in the form of direct attacks against ISIS targets. Saudi Arabia had already said it would provide the U.S. with access to military bases for training rebel forces to fight ISIS.\n\nTurkey did not sign the communique, and is in a tough spot diplomatically because ISIS currently holds 49 Turkish diplomats in Iraq as hostages.\n\nArab state participation in combat operations alongside the U.S. is unusual, but not unprecedented. Saudi Arabia, for example, took part in the first Gulf War in 1991 to expel Iraqi forces from the neighboring nation of Kuwait.\n\nOn Saturday, ISIS released a new video showing the killing of another western hostage, British aid worker David Haines. In that video, an ISIS member named another British captive as the group's next target. The group has already killed two American journalists, James Foley and Steven Sotloff. \n\nThose killings, along with the rapid territorial gains that ISIS has made in Iraq, helped convince U.S. President Barack Obama's administration to take a more aggressive stance in confronting the organization. \n\nHave something to add to this story?
