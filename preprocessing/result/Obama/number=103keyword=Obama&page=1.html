imperial japanese navy officershrines and temples[edit]wakasahiko shrinerelationship with u.s. president barack obama[edit]the city of obama has received much publicity because it shares its name with u.s. president barack obama. it began when obama as a senator gave a 2006 interview to japanese television network tbs where he noted that, when passing through customs in narita airport, the official who inspected his visa said that he was from obama.[13] the obama city hall heard about the interview and the mayor, toshio murakami, sent senator obama a set of the city’s famous lacquer chopsticks, a dvd about the city and a letter wishing him the best. as senator obama's presidential campaign progressed, more local businesses began to organize primary parties and put up "go obama!" posters, sell "i love obama" t-shirts, and produce manjū (a type of japanese confectionery) with senator obama's face on them. a hula group began in the town in honour of senator obama's home state of hawaii. the troupe visited honolulu in june to perform at the pan pacific festival.[14]president obama has since thanked the town for their gifts and support, saying "i look forward to a future marked by the continued friendship of our two great nations and a shared commitment to a better, freer world".[1]there are a number of japanese with the surname obama. though the american president is of kenyan luo heritage, it is not uncommon for japanese and east african names to sound alike. additionally, many japanese report that the swahili language is far easier to learn than english.[15][16] as a result of the victory by barack obama in the 2008 presidential election, the mayor of obama city announced to the japanese press that he intends to commission a statue of barack obama to be put in front of the city hall "as a token of the great historical moment for the name obama".[17]on january 20, 2009, the day that barack obama was sworn into office, the city of obama celebrated the inauguration with women dancing the hula at the hagaji temple.[18]on november 14, 2009, president obama specifically acknowledged his connection with obama by mentioning it and its citizens in a speech at suntory hall in tokyo.[19]references[edit]isao soranaka: obama: the rise and decline of a seaport. in: monumenta nipponica, jg. 52, nr. 1, 1997. issn0027-2741^ a b alabaster, jay (2008-11-05).
