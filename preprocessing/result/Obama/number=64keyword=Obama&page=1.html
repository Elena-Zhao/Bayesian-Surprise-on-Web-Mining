what of the poor in this country, who cannot afford housing? what about the sick and malnourished? don't you care about these people? don't you claim to be a follower of jesus?!supporting a murderous political agenda with such an argument is tragic!and what do we know about obama? he is the single most anti-life proponent that has ever run for the office of president. joseph bayly tags: abortion, culture-of-death, holocausts, infanticide, murder, obama, obamanation, political-office, presidency, presidents, racial-equality 22 likes like i am not a one-issue voter in the sense that indicates i am an ignorant fundamentalist who only cares about one thing. i believe in protecting the environment. i believe in caring for the poor, the orphan, the widow in her distress. these are some of the so-called "issues" that many of us use to justify voting for obama. how can we possibly claim it is christian love for the poor and helpless that motivates us to vote for such a man when he is so committed to the killing of the most helpless among us? joseph bayly tags: abortion, christian-love, murder, obama, obamanation, one-issue-voting, the-defenseless 18 likes like he's one fry short of a happy meal. rush limbaugh tags: humor, intellect, intelligence, obama 15 likes like a knock down has never been a knockout unless you allow it. jaachynma n.e. agu, the prince and the pauper tags: accomplishments, agu, be-different, chiyson, greater-glory, higher-life, jaachynma, kingstreasurehouse, obama, success, the-best-option, the-prince-and-the-pauper 13 likes like if you think all these terrible things about obama, he asked the woman, how can you possibly be undecided?because if mccain dies, palin would be president, she said. john heilemann, game change: obama and the clintons, mccain and palin, and the race of a lifetime tags: 2008-presidential-election, obama, palin 9 likes like yes we can't! sergio aragonés tags: barack-obama, mccain, obama, president 6 likes like strange star-like object over oslo right before obama arrives. a gift of a golden medal given by a group of wise men... nah. craig ferguson tags: jesus, nobel-prize, obama, sacrilege 6 likes like what if the mightiest word is love, love beyond marital, filial, national. love that casts a widening pool of light. love with no need to preempt grievance.in today's sharp sparkle, this winter air, anything can be made, any sentence begun.on the brink, on the brim, on the cusp -- praise song for walking forward in that light. elizabeth alexander tags: inauguration, inspirational, obama, poetry 6 likes like there are men regarded today as brilliant economists, who deprecate saving and recommend squandering on a national scale as the way of economic salvation; and when anyone points to what the consequences of these policies will be in the long run, they reply flippantly, as might the prodigal son of a warning father: "in the long run we are all dead." and such shallow wisecracks pass as devastating epigrams and the ripest wisdom. henry hazlitt, economics in one lesson: the shortest surest way to understand basic economics tags: economics, fdr, keynes, obama, progressivism 6 likes like in politics, nothing is contemptible. benjamin disraeli tags: honesty, obama, opinion, politics 6 likes like in times of crisis, you get a public reaction that is incoherence on stilts. on the one hand, most people know that the government is not in the oil business. they don't want it in the oil business. they know there is nothing a man in washington can do to plug a hole a mile down in the gulf.on the other hand, they demand that the president 'take control.' they demand that he hold press conferences, show leadership, announce that the buck stops here and do something. they want him to emote and perform the proper theatrical gestures so they can see their emotions enacted on the public stage.they want to hold him responsible for things they know he doesn't control. their reaction is a mixture of disgust, anger, longing and need. it may not make sense. but it doesn't make sense that the country wants spending cuts and doesn't want cuts, wants change and doesn't want change. david brooks tags: deepwater-horizon-oil-spill, emotion, obama, politics, vox-populi 5 likes like don`t allow ignorance to further enslave your destiny. jaachynma n.e. agu, the prince and the pauper tags: accomplishment, agu, books-reading, chiyson, jaachynma, obama, success, the-champion-in-all-of-us, wealth-creation 4 likes like but for a younger generation of conservative operatives who would soon rise to power... they were true believers who meant what they said, whether it was 'no new taxes' or 'we are a christian nation.' in fact, with their rigid doctrines, slash-and-burn style, and exaggerated sense of having been aggrieved, this new conservative leadership was eerily reminiscent of some of the new left's leaders during the sixties. as with their left-wing counterparts, this new vanguard of the right viewed politics as a contest not just between competing policy visions, but between good and evil. activists in both parties began developing litmus tests, checklists of orthodoxy, leaving a democrat who questioned abortion increasingly lonely, any republican who championed gun control effectively marooned. in this manichean struggle, compromise came to look like weakness, to be punished or purged. you were with us or you were against us. you had to choose sides. barack obama tags: obama, polarizing, politics 4 likes like mcchrystal never should have been hired for this job given the outrageous cover-up he participated in after the friendly fire death of pat tillman. he was lucky to keep the job after his 'seven days in may' stunt in london last year when he openly lobbied and undercut the president on the surge.but with the latest sassing, and the continued sisyphean nature of the surge he urged, mcchrystal should offer his resignation. he should try subordination for a change. maureen dowd tags: coverups, friendly-fire, insubordination, london, obama, pat-tillman, sassing, speeches, stanley-mcchrystal, war-in-afghanistan-2001 3 likes like barack obama will appeal to both black and white voters in america. white voters who'll think he's tiger woods. frankie boyle tags: barack-obama, obama, tiger, voters, woods 3 likes like what makes a man a 'sophist' is not his faculty, but his moral purpose. (1355b 17) aristotle, the art of rhetoric tags: obama, rhetoric, sophists 3 likes like there wasn't even enough meat to make proper fun of [....] i keep waiting for somebody else to come on tv, maybe a cabinet member, to read the real speech, the one that tells us ... i dunno ... stuff. seriously, sorority girls have done the walk of shame home from frat parties feeling more satisfied. stephen green tags: 2010, deepwater-horizon-oil-spill, frats, obama, politics, sororities, speeches, united-states 3 likes like you have two choices, [plouffe] told obama. you can stay in the senate, enjoy your weekends at home, take regular vacations, and have a lovely time with your family. or you can run for president, have your whole life poked at and pried into, almost never see your family, travel incessantly, bang your tin cup for donations like some street-corner beggar, lead a lonely, miserable life. john heilemann, mark halperin, game change: obama and the clintons, mccain and palin, and the race of a lifetime tags: obama, politics, president-obama, presidential-election 2 likes like but know this america: we will meet them barack obama tags: insparational, obama, president 1 likes like the president of the united states, if you remove his blackness, then just ask the question, is he a good president or is he a bad president for the united states? just remove the blackness and make that decision. ken hutcherson tags: black, obama, president 1 likes like [obama] was highly praised, including by his supporters, for his statesmanlike attitude during the lame-duck session, bipartisanship, and getting legislation through. what did he get through? the main achievement was a huge tax cut for the extremely wealthy...meanwhile, at the same time, he initiated a tax increase on federal workers. of course, no one called it a tax increase. that doesn't sound good. they called it a pay freeze. but a pay freeze on public-sector workers is exactly the same thing as a tax increase. so we punish public-sector workers and reward the executives of goldman sachs, who just announced a $17.5 billion compensation package for themselves. noam chomsky, power systems: conversations on global democratic uprisings and the new challenges to u.s. empire tags: noam-chomsky, obama, taxes 0 likes like extraits du poème: sagessequand là-bas, au ghana, obama refaçonne la baule,de l’afrique que font les africains ?rappelle-toi le message de senghor te disant :pense par toi-même, pour toi-même !de mandela qui t’enseigne à devenir mieux que ce tu es,... abdou karim gueye poésie comme un amas de pyramides inversées tags: afrique, mandela, obama, poète-abdou-karim-gueye, poésie-abdou-karim-gueye 0 likes like we hear things like “we elected a black president,” as if that event was the magic eraser to wipe away all of the racial problems in our country in one fell swoop.but that would be like saying that in 1932, we elected a president with a physical disability, so we should stop building ramps and having reserved handicap spaces because that’s reverse discrimination against the able-bodied simon s. tam tags: equity, fdr, justice, obama, racism, reverse-racism, social-justice 0 likes like « previous 1 2 3 next » all quotes | my quotes | add a quote browse by tag love (34771) humor (31579) inspirational (23502) life (22841) funny (7320) romance (7197) death (6779) writing (6442) god (6276) truth (6242) poetry (5462) wisdom (5447) philosophy (5330) religion (5096) science (4436) happiness (4413) inspiration (4386) books (4229) faith (4127) relationships (4096) inspirational-quotes (3841) success (3605) humour (3448) politics (3259) hope (3257) art (3254) reading (3197) women (3153) war (3139) friendship (3116) more... 2014 goodreads inc about us advertise author program jobs api our blog terms privacy help switch to: mobile version welcome back. just a moment while we sign you in to your goodreads account.
