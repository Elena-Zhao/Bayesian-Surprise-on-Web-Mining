"and police officers are now at a disadvantage, because someone can tape the last part of an encounter and not tape the first part of the encounter. and it gives the impression that the police officer has overreacted when they haven't."mccaskill made the comments at an event in springfield, missouri, where she answered questions about the shooting of michael brown by ferguson police officer darren wilson, cnn affiliate kolr reported.in the wake of the shooting and community outrage to the response from ferguson police, mccaskill has called for congressional hearings to examine a defense department program that allows local police departments to acquire military weaponry.already, president barack obama has called for a review of programs that allow for the transfer of military weapons to the police.section 1208 in the national defense authorization act has allowed the defense department to grant military hardware to local law enforcement since 1990. a law enforcement support program, the military's defense logistics agency, was established in 1999 to facilitate law enforcement militarization.mccaskill said thursday she hopes the senate will embrace her body camera proposal and that it will eventually become law."i would like to see us say, 'if you want federal funding in your community, you've got to have body cams on your officers,'" she said. "and i think that would go a long way towards solving some of these problems, and it would be a great legacy over this tragedy that's occurred in ferguson, regardless of what the facts say at the end as to whether or not anyone is criminally culpable." filed under: claire mccaskilldepartment of defensefergusonmissouripresident obama august 26th, 2014 07:15 am et share this on: facebook twitter digg del.icio.us reddit myspace stumbleupon comments (167 comments) 2 months ago obama announces new efforts for vets in politically tinged north carolina visitposted bycnn white house producer kevin liptak updated 2:05 p.m. et, 8/26/2014charlotte (cnn) president barack obama detailed tuesday how his administration is attempting to rectify shortfalls in caring for war veterans, just as new threats abroad could require more sacrifices for american military families.speaking at the annual american legion conference in charlotte, obama announced new executive actions aimed at improving mental health services and financial opportunities for servicemen and women, months after allegations of massive wrongdoing surfaced at the department of veterans affairs. full post filed under: president obamaveteransveterans affairs president barack obama speaks in edgartown, mass., wednesday, aug. 20, 2014, about the killing of american journalist james foley by militants with the islamic state extremist group. august 24th, 2014 03:41 pm et share this on: facebook twitter digg del.icio.us reddit myspace stumbleupon comments (39 comments) 2 months ago as vacation winds down, obama faces calls for stronger leadership on isisposted bycnn's cassie spodak (cnn) washington - on president barack obama’s last day of a troubled vacation, politicians criticized his leadership and called for action in the growing threat of terrorist group isis.“the president has got to come forward with a cohesive, comprehensive strategy, not only in iraq, but also in ukraine, also in other parts of the world. this is an administration - which the kindest word i can use is feckless - where they have not outlined a role that the united states of america has to play, and that’s a leadership role,” sen. john mccain, r-arizona, said on “fox news sunday.”in the wake of the beheading of american journalist james foley, administration officials made clear that they are shifting from defensive operations against isis in iraq to weighing an attack on isis where they are strongest, in syria. but politicians on both sides of the aisle are impatient for the president to construct a plan and consult with congress on what many see as an imminent threat from isis, which calls itself the islamic state and is called isil by some u.s. government officials. full post filed under: isisjack reedjohn mccainkelly ayottelindsey grahammike mccaulobama administrationpresident obama august 18th, 2014 09:24 am et share this on: facebook twitter digg del.icio.us reddit myspace stumbleupon comments (69 comments) 3 months ago obama on hiatus from vacation with iraq, ferguson on his agendaposted bycnn's cassie spodak washington (cnn) president barack obama returned to the white house late sunday night, taking the unusual step of interrupting his martha's vineyard vacation for two days. the short visit was announced on august 6, the day before obama authorized targeted airstrikes in iraq aimed at protecting u.s. personnel and preventing a potential genocide of minorities by terrorist group isis. full post filed under: president obama older posts follow this blog: twitter. from cnn politicsgov.s ebola myth: water kills it october 16, 2014 07:20 pmsecurity hole may expose your kids info september 16, 2014 05:56 pmwhy joe biden would love a 50-50 senate october 31, 2014 08:51 pmsound like a political junkie with these 2014 midterm facts november 1, 2014 07:13 pmconvicted mayor wants final rodeo october 31, 2014 01:40 pmmary landrieu blames racism for obamas unpopularity in louisiana october 31, 2014 03:33 pmrelated links cnnpolitics.comcomplete coverage: 2014 midterm electionskey races to watch in 2014 recent posts farewell to the ticker gop challenger dan sullivan leads mark begich in alaska senate race will mitt romney take the plunge again?
