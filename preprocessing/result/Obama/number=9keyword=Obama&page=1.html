i think so. working against the democrats is the six-year jinx. six years into an incumbent's tenure, the president's party almost always loses seats in congress. the republicans got clobbered in eisenhower's sixth year, 1958, and in bush ii's sixth year, 2006. even franklin roosevelt's democrats lost massively in his sixth year, 1938. can you guess the one recent exception? it was bill clinton in 1998 -- right after the lewinsky sex scandal and clinton's impeachment, no less. the dems actually picked up five house seats. how on earth did the wily clinton and the dems pull off that feat? robert kuttner co-founder and co-editor, 'the american prospect' this election's biggest jokes: 'republicans are the saviors of social security and medicare!' and 'republicans will end gridlock.' republicans in 2011 and 2013 voted to transform medicare into a voucher program. and, yet these same republicans are attacking democrats who fought for these popular programs, who sometimes lost their seats due to signaling a willingness to compromise. paul abrams last person on earth not on facebook climate change this week: coal's creepy cancer, saving capitalism from polluters and more! ari phillips at climate progress. three major companies - cisco systems, 3m, and kimberly clark - announced they will now give employees a deeply discounted way of buying or leasing solar panels for their homes. sunny news, indeed! mary ellen harte biologist and author running against the 'obama economy' - and winning?

i can safely say obama is only president in u.s. history whose approval rating dropped a single digit over a 10-month stretch and it was described as having "plummeted." eric boehlert senior fellow, media matters for america millennials openly defy the obamacare mandate millennials are openly defying the government mandate and thumbing their noses at legislators who continue to ignore the issues critical to young americans. they're fed up with government forcing them to pay for the poor financial decisions of previous generations. brad chase communications strategist at capitol media partners / adjunct professor at the university of southern california / world traveler at the neverending chase it's up to us on november 4th: the 2014 elections and beyond while the pundits and pollsters are predicting a republican takeover of the senate, it would be wise to take their prognostications with a grain of salt and not let them become a self-fulfilling prophesy. after all, even those so-called "experts" are not infallible. pearl korn advocate for improved medicare for all tunisia's elections revives hope for change this week, tunisia rescued what was called four years ago the jasmine revolution, which gave birth to the arab spring, by letting the whole know that it rejects imposing religion on the state, and that it insists on secularism and modernity. raghida dergham columnist and senior diplomatic correspondent, al hayat e-boo!-la hello, my name is dr. francis collins, and i am the director of the national institutes of health. thank you for joining us for this live-blogging session. i am here to answer all your questions about ebola or any other health issue. let's get started. john k. herr speechwriter and standup comedian with the elections coming to an end, it's time for executive action it was a miscalculation to delay action on immigration back in september, and it will continue to be a blight on the community's trust of the administration if, after november 4, president obama does not act swiftly and use his authority to remedy the inaction of a gridlocked congress. nclr action fund the nclr action fund works to empower the latino community nationwide. early learning needs to be national priority state funding per child for preschool programs has declined over the last decade. in the most recent year for which statistics are available, 9,000 fewer 4-year-olds participated in publicly-funded preschool. gloria bonilla santiago board chair, leap academy university charter school the consequences of delayed executive action for many of immigrants, the president's decision to delay taking action on immigration meant the difference between staying with their families in the united states and being deported to their countries of origin, often after having lived in the united states for several years. national council of la raza the largest national latino civil rights and advocacy organization in the united states what is wrong with president obama?
