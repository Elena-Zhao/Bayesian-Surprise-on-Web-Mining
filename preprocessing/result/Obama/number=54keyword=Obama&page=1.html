chief of staff denis mcdonough called the whole cabinet in. the midterms were looming. the lawyers said cabinet secretaries aren�t allowed to campaign, but mcdonough told them they needed to do a whole lot more to promote the administration�s �positive economic message.� their efforts do not appear to have done any good. obama�s numbers, if anything, have gone down, and the only question

renowned weapons smuggler to continue working for mexican drug cartels even after the agency had more than enough evidence to indict him, according to a federal audit made public this week. as if this weren�t bad enough, the case is all the more outrageous because it involves the same preposterous strategy the administration used in the disastrous gun-running operation known as fast and furious.
