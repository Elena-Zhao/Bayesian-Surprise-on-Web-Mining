[april 2014]. personal quotes (61) [from keynote speech given at the 2004 democratic party national convention] there's not a liberal america and a conservative america. there's the united states of america. we worship an awesome god in the blue states, and we don't like federal agents poking around our libraries in the red states. we coach little league in the blue states, and have gay friends in the red states. there are patriots who opposed the war, and patriots who supported it. we are one people, all of us pledging allegiance to the stars and stripes, all of us defending the united states of america. and it lives on in those americans -- young and old, rich and poor, black and white, latino and asian and native american, gay and straight -- who are tired of a politics that divides us and want to recapture the sense of common purpose that we had when john kennedy was president of the united states of america. [regarding former president bill clinton's support for his wife--and obama's opponent for the 2008 democratic presidential nomination--hillary rodham clinton] sometimes i don't know who i'm running against. [when asked whether he would call on bill clinton and hillary rodham clinton to release their tax returns, after hilary loaned $5 million of her own money to her campaign] i'll just say that i've released my tax returns. that's been a policy i've maintained consistently. i think the american people deserve to know where you get your income from. but i'll leave it up to you guys to chase it down . . . i think we set the bar in terms of transparency and disclosure that has been a consistent theme of my campaign and my career in politics. in the unlikely story that is america, there has never been anything false about hope. when i am this party's [democratic party] nominee, my opponent will not be able to say that i voted for the war in iraq; or that i gave [george w. bush] the benefit of the doubt on iran; or that i supported bush-cheney [former vp dick cheney] policies of not talking to leaders that we don't like. and he will not be able to say that i wavered on something as fundamental as whether or not it is okay for america to torture - because it is never okay. that's why i am in it.as president, i will end the war in iraq. we will have our troops home in sixteen months. i will close guantanamo. i will restore habeas corpus. i will finish the fight against al qaeda. and i will lead the world to combat the common threats of the 21st century - nuclear weapons and terrorism; climate change and poverty; genocide and disease. and i will send once more a message to those yearning faces beyond our shores that says, "you matter to us. your future is our future. and our moment is now." this time we want to talk about the crumbling schools that are stealing the future of black children and white children and asian children and hispanic children and native american children. this time we want to reject the cynicism that tells us that these kids can't learn; that those kids who don't look like us are somebody else's problem. the children of america are not those kids, they are our kids, and we will not let them fall behind in a 21st century economy. not this time. change is coming to america. in america, we have this strong bias toward individual action. you know, we idolize the john wayne hero who comes in to correct things with both guns blazing. but individual actions, individual dreams, are not sufficient. we must unite in collective action, build collective institutions and organizations. in washington, the call this the ownership society, and it is especially tempting because each of us believes we will always be the winner in life's lottery, that we're the one who will be the next donald trump, or at least we won't be the chump who donald trump says: "you're fired!" in america, we have this strong bias toward individual action. you know we idolize the john wayne hero who comes in to correct things with both guns blazing. but individual actions, individual dreams are not sufficient. we must unite in collective action, build collective institutions and organizations. in washington, we call this the ownership society, and it is especially tempting because each of us believes we will always be the winner in life's lottery, that we're the one who will be the next donald trump, or at least we won't be the chump who donald trump says: "you're fired!" to avoid being mistaken for a sellout, i chose my friends carefully. the more politically active black students. the foreign students. the chicanos. the marxist professors and the structural feminists and punk rock performance poets. we smoked cigarettes and wore leather jackets. at night in the dorms, we discussed neocolonialism, franz fanon, eurocentrism and patriarchy. when we ground our cigarettes in the hallway carpet or set our stereos so loud that the walls began to shake, we were resisting bourgeois society's stifling constraints. we weren't indifferent or careless or insecure. we were alienated. (visiting ireland) my name is barack obama of the moneygall o'bamas. and i've come to find the apostrophe we lost along the way. hopefully, more and more people will begin to feel their story is somehow a part of the larger story of how we're going to reshape america in a way that is less mean spirited and more generous. i mean i really hope to be a part of the transformation of this country. i'm not interested in the suburbs. the suburbs bore me. and i'm not interested in isolating myself. i feel good when i'm engaged in what i think are the core issues of the society, and those issues to me are what's happening to poor folks in this society. it's crucial that people don't see my election as a sign of progress in the broader sense that we don't sort of point to a barack obama any more than you point to a bill cosby or a michael jordan and say "well things are hunky dory". to that extent, as radical as i think people try to characterize the warren court, it wasn't that radical. it didn't break free from the essential constraints that were placed by the founding fathers in the constitution, or at least as it's been interpreted and warren court interpreted in the same way, that generally the constitution is a charter of negative liberties, says what the states can't do to you. says what the federal government can't do to you, but doesn't say what the federal government or the state government must do on your behalf, and that has shifted and one of the, i think, tragedies of the civil rights movement was, um, because the civil rights movement became so court focused i think there was a tendency to lose track of the political and community organizing and activities on the ground that are able to put together the actual coalition of powers through which you bring about redistributive change. in some ways we still suffer from that. anger over welfare and affirmative action helped forge the reagan coalition. politicians routinely exploited fears of crime for their own electoral ends. talk show hosts and conservative commentators built entire careers unmasking bogus claims of racism while dismissing legitimate discussions of racial injustice and inequality as mere political correctness or reverse racism. you go into these small towns in pennsylvania and, like a lot of small towns in the midwest, the jobs have been gone now for 25 years, and nothing's replaced them. and they fell through the clinton administration, and the bush administration, and each successive administration has said somehow these communities are going to regenerate and they have not. and it's not surprising then they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations. it's great to be here this evening in the vast, magnificent hilton ballroom, or what mitt romney would call a little fixer-upper. you know, malia and sasha, they have friends whose parents are same-sex couples. there have been times where michelle and i have been sitting around the dinner table and we're talking about their friends and their parents and malia and sasha, it wouldn't dawn on them that somehow their friends' parents would be treated differently. it doesn't make sense to them and frankly, that's the kind of thing that prompts a change in perspective. (may 9, 2012) i have to tell you that over the course of several years, as i have talked to friends and family and neighbors, when i think about members of my own staff who are in incredibly committed monogamous relationships, same-sex relationships, who are raising kids together, when i think about those soldiers or airmen or marines or sailors who are out there fighting on my behalf and yet feel constrained, even now that don't ask don't tell is gone, because they are not able to commit themselves in a marriage, at a certain point i've just concluded that for me, personally, it is important for me to go ahead and affirm that i think same sex couples should be able to get married. (may 9, 2012) i believe the majority of gun owners would agree we should do everything possible to prevent criminals and fugitives from purchasing weapons. and we should check someone's criminal record before they can check out a gun seller. a mentally unbalanced individual should not be able to get his hands on a gun so easily. these steps shouldn't be controversial. they should be common sense. we can't continue to sustain a situation in which some countries are maintaining surpluses, others massive deficits and there never is the kind of adjustment with respect to currency that would lead to a more balanced growth pattern. my image of onyango, faint as it was, has always been of an autocratic man - a cruel man, perhaps. but i had also imagined him an independent man, a man of his people, opposed to white rule... what granny had told us scrambled that image completely, causing ugly words to flash across my mind. uncle tom. collaborator. house nigger. the only way my life makes sense is if - regardless of culture, race, religion, tribe - there is this commonality, these essential human truths and passions and hope and moral precepts, that we can reach out beyond our differences. if that is not the case, then it is pretty hard for me to make sense of my life. that is the core of who i am. [on election night, november 4, 2008] this is your victory. i will ask you to join in the work of remaking this nation, the only way it's been done in america for 221 years - block by block, brick by brick, callused hand by callused hand. [on the political choice as he sees it in 2012] this isn't a matter of who's more patriotic or who is more empathetic toward people or who is nicer. it's a hardheaded assessment of what makes our economy grow. and the facts are on my side in this argument. part of the reason that our politics seems so tough right now, and facts and science and argument does not seem to be winning the day all the time, is because we're hardwired not to think clearly when we're scared. what i wake up determined to accomplish every single day is making the best decisions i can. and the only thing then to guide you is what you genuinely think is best for the country. because if you start trying to guess what's going to be most politically advantageous or try to game all that stuff out, you'll get lost very quickly. we can't drive our suvs and eat as much as we want and keep our homes on 72 degrees at all times... and then just expect that other countries are going to say ok. that's not leadership. that's not going to happen. i do think at a certain point you've made enough money. if you were successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. there was a great teacher somewhere in your life. somebody helped to create this unbelievable american system that we have allowed you to thrive. somebody invested in roads and bridges. if you've got a business - you didn't build that. somebody else made that happen. governor romney seems to have a tendency to shoot first and aim later. as president of our country and commander-in-chief of our military, i accept that people are going to call me awful things every day, and i will always defend their right to do so. if you can't beat your opponent's ideas, you distort those ideas and maybe make some up. if you don't have a record to run on, than you paint your opponent as someone people should run away from. [on donald trump's refusal to trust the validity of the president's personal documents] this all dates back to when we were growing up together in kenya. i've always believed that education begins at home, with parents who take responsibility - who read to their kids, set limits on the tv and instill a lifelong love of learning. but there is no substitute for a good school or the teacher who stands in front of the classroom. [to the crowd at the 2013 presidential inauguration] i want to look out one more time. i'm not going to see this again. the truth is that we have steadily become a more diverse and tolerant country that embraces people's differences and respect people who are not like us. that's a profoundly good thing. that's one of the strengths of america. [on the 2012 campaign trail] if you buy into the cynicism that the change we fought for isn't possible, well, change will not happen. other voices will fill the void: lobbyists and special interests, the people with ten million dollar checks who are trying to buy this election. [on senator tom coburn (r-oklahoma)] the people of oklahoma are lucky to have someone like tom representing them in washington - someone who speaks his mind, sticks to his principles and is committed to the people he was elected to serve. each of us still hopes the other will see the light. but in the meantime, we'll settle for being friends. [ at the 2009 white house correspondents dinner] mother's day is a tough holiday for rahm emanuel because he's not used to saying the word 'day' after 'mother'. ak-47s belong in the hands of soldiers and not in the hands of crooks. they belong on the battlefield of war, not on the streets of our cities. [on nelson mandela] i had read his writings and speeches and understood this was somebody who believed in the basic principle i just talked about - treating people equally. he was willing to sacrifice his life for that belief. he's a personal hero, but i don't think i'm unique in that regard. he's a hero for the world. if and when he passes from this place, one thing we all know is that his legacy is one that will linger on throughout the ages. we discussed the fact that ho chi minh was actually inspired by the u.s. declaration of independence and constitution, and the words of thomas jefferson. trayvon martin could have been me thirty-five years ago. [on the outlawed use of poison gas in syria] i didn't set a red line, the world set a red line. [to dmitri medvedev] this is my last election, after my election, i'll have more flexibility. [on why he quit smoking] i haven't had a cigarette in probably six years. that's because i'm scared of my wife. [on critics of american engagement with iran, 2013] tough talk and bluster may be the easy thing to do politically, but it's not the right thing to do for our security. no party has a monopoly on wisdom. [from a 2012 campaign speech] if you give up on the idea that your voice can make a difference, then other voices will fill the void: the lobbyists and special interests; the people with the $10 million checks who are trying to buy this election, and those who are making it harder for you to vote. [on the passing of pete seeger at age 94] once called 'america's tuning fork', pete seeger believed deeply in the power of song. but more importantly, he believed in the power of community - to stand up for what's right, speak out against what's wrong, and move this country closer to the america he knew we could be. over the years, pete used his voice - and his hammer - to strike blows for workers' rights and civil rights; world peace and environmental conservation. and he always invited us to sing along. for reminding us where we came from and showing us where we need to go, we will always be grateful for pete seeger. [at the 2014 white house correspondents' dinner, on government gridlock] if you want to get paid while not working, you should have to run for congress like everyone else. [in response to the issue of rising us gun violence after another school shooting] we're the only developed country on earth where this happens. and it happens now once a week. and it's a one-day story. there's no place else like this. [downplaying the role of military action in u.s. global leadership] just because we have the best hammer does not mean that every problem is a nail. [to the graduating class at west point, 2014] for the foreseeable future, the most direct threat to america, at home and abroad, remains terrorism. but a strategy that involves invading every country that harbours terrorist networks is naive and unsustainable. [2014 white house correspondents' dinner speech] it is great to be back. what a year, huh? i usually start these dinners with a few self-deprecating jokes. after my stellar 2013, what can i possibly talk about? i admit it - last year was rough. sheesh. at one point, things got so bad, the 47 percent called mitt romney to apologize. [2014 white house correspondents' dinner speech] let's face it, fox, you'll miss me when i'm gone. it will be harder to convince the american people that hillary was born in kenya. see also other works| publicity listings| official sites| contact info getting started |contributor zone contribute to this page edit page add resume barack obama personal details biography other works publicity listings official sites contact info (imdbpro) filmography by year by job by ratings by votes by genre by keyword did you know? personal quotes trivia trademark photo & video photo gallery trailers and videos opinion awards message boards related items credited with tv schedule newsdesk external sites professional services promote yourself with a resume add or change photos get more at imdbpro explore more show less share this page: create a list user lists related lists from imdb users top black martial artist you may or may not know about a list of 47 people created 16dec2011 celebrities i would love to see get a bio pic movie based on their lives. a list of 29 people created 10jul2012 hottest black males a list of 46 people created 18oct2012 celebrities with exotic features (interesting/unique look) a list of 37 people created 04feb2013 famous fans of 24 a list of 22 people created 4monthsago see all related lists home | search | site index | in theaters | coming soon | top movies | top 250 | tv | news | message boards | press room register | advertising | contact us | jobs | imdbpro | box office mojo | withoutabox imdb mobile: iphone/ipad | android | mobile site | windows phone 7 | imdb social: facebook | twitter copyright 1990-2014 imdb.com, inc. conditions of use | privacy policy | interest-based ads an company. amazon affiliates amazon instant video watch movies online prime instant video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
