obama - obey giant aboutgallerystoreobamaupdate: thanks for all those who bought the print in support of obey and obama. unfortunately, the print is sold out and we do not plan on producing another edition. the edition was released earlier today with great response. the progress screenprint was exclusively available through obey and the hope offset print will be distributed by the obama camp as an awareness campaign.i believe with great conviction that barack obama should be the next president. i have been paying close attention to him since the democratic convention in 2004. i feel that he is more a statesman than a politician. he was against the war when it was an unpopular position (and hillary was for the war at that time), obama is for energy and environmental conservation. he is for healthcare reform. check him out for yourself proceeds from this print go to produce prints for a large statewide poster campaign.thanks.-shepardthose of you who emails us, thank you. but we dont have anymore! this screenprint is 24 x 36, edition of 350. available next wednesday, january 30th, 2009. relatedpower glory day of the dead skull (gold)power glory day of the dead skull (red)sold out, thank you!// an important message from shepard fairey, part 2// an important message from shepard fairey// support the occupy movement x free downloads// the associated press case updateexhibitionsarticlesessaysinterviewsreviewsmediasightingswarningsurban renewal kitbootlegstattoosprint archivefine art archivecollectibles archiveobey clothingcontact mailing list follow @obeygiantcopyright 1989 - 2014. all rights reserved.7ads6x98y
