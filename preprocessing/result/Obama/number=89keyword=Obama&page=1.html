violated the companies statement of rights and responsibilities, sos reuploaded the image, resulting in a 24-hour freeze of their account.on october 30th, the current events blog breitbart[8] published a post titled “facebook reverses, allows seals’ post critical of obama,” which reported that facebook manager andrew noyes had informed breitbart that the removal of the image was an error and not an act of censorship. the same day, comedian dennis miller tweeted that obama was responsible for the removal of the image macro (shown below).obama shuts down facebook on benghazi posts. only

2013despite hananel’s correction, the message became retweeted more than 3,000 times in the span of four minutes before twitter suspended the account at 1:14 p.m. (et), according to the next web.[23] meanwhile, the dow jones industrial average immediately plummeted (shown below) in response to the false rumor, though it quickly rebounded once the tweet was debunked as a lie.within the next hour,

(sea) took responsibility for the hack via its twitter account @official_sea6[22], which was subsequently suspended. in the months leading up to the ap hack, the group managed to compromise the

revealed as a marketing stunt staged for the samsung galaxy note 3 smartphone, which prompted the white house senior adviser dan pfeiffer to release a statement during his tv appearance on cbs face the nation on april 6th:“in general, whenever someone tries to use the president’s likeness to promote a product, that’s a problem. we’ve had conversations with samsung about this and have expressed our concerns.”““maybe this will be the end of all selfies.”on april 7th, pfeiffer’s remarks were repeatedly quoted in the news as a hint that presidential selfies may soon be banned, but when asked for more details, the white house press secretary jay carney said monday there’s “no discussion of a ban” on presidential selfies. meanwhile, samsung acknowledged that ortiz had a sponsorship deal with the company but insisted that the selfie itself wasn’t premeditated.reputationusage of verbal pausesthough barack obama is known as an exceptional orator[11], he is often critiqued for his use of non-lexical fillers[12] such as “huh” and “umm.” in march 2008, late night host david letterman compiled a supercut of one of the president’s speeches in order to count how many times he used these verbal pauses.in march 2009, blogger bob mccarty[13] analyzed a textual transcript of a white house news conference, finding the president used a version of “huh” a total of 319 times, once every nine seconds. since he has been elected, obama has been criticized for this manner of speech by several outlets including on yahoo! answers[14], political blog hot air[15], news blog the blaze[16] and as a part of obama’s portrayal on saturday night live (shown below).related memesobama has often been the subject of videos, image macros and animated gifs. on april 6th, 2012, the tech news blog

and characters began appearing as well, mimicking the red, beige and blue color scheme of the original version.brock obamabrock obama is a fictional hybrid character combining president obama and brock, one of the main trainer characters from the anime series pokémon. the character is usually manifested in the form of photoshopped images with brock’s head or face superimposed onto portrait

effect.zombie mccainzombie mccain is a photoshop meme that spawned from a puzzling photo of four-time arizona senator john mccain taken shortly after the third and final presidential debate with obama

his campaign speech in roanoke, virginia on july 13th, 2012. while it was intended to emphasize the role of government in fostering the growth of american businesses, the soundbite quickly disseminated across the conservative political blogosphere and spawned a bipartisan debate on income taxes and other economic policy issues. cell phone photoin late october of 2012, an associated press photographer took a picture of obama on the phone at a campaign fundraiser event in orlando, florida (shown below). according to a tweet by abc news reporter devin dwyer[3] on october 28th, the

uproxx.[5] thanks, obama!“thanks, obama!” is a sarcastic expression used by critics of president barack obama to blame personal troubles and inconveniences on public policies supported or enacted by the administration. the phrase is often used to caption animated gifs in which the subject appears to be struggling with a rather simple task, satirizing those who scapegoat obama as the cause of problems for which he has little or no influence. obama is checking your emailon june 6th, 2013, the guardian[28] published an article reporting on a secret united states national security agency (nsa) program named “prism”, which granted the agency the power to gain direct access to search history, emails, file transfers and live chats from various internet services, including those provided by google, facebook and apple. on june 8th, the “obama is checking your email” tumblr[29] blog was launched to mock the obama administration’s involvement in the surveillance scandal, highlighting various photographs of obama staring at computer monitors and smart phone screens as if he is spying on private citizens (shown below). two days later on june 10th, several news and tech sites highlighted notable examples from the tumblr blog, including buzzfeed,[30] the daily dot,[31] mashable[32] and the new york daily news.[33] the same day, redditor sligowaths posted a link to the blog on the /r/toosoon[34] subreddit, where it gained upwards of 820 up votes and 40 comments in the first 24 hours.h2. search interestexternal references[1]reddit ama – i am barack obama, president of the
