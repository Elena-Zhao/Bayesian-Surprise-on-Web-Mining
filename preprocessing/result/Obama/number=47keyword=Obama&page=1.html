[1] indonesia and the influence of islamstanley ann dunham would go on to marry an indonesian muslim, lolo soetoro, and moved to jakarta, indonesia, where the family lived for four years. she later gave birth to a daughter, maya soetoro.while in indonesia obama attended two different grade schools. the first one was the franciscan asisi primary school where he claimed he became fluent in the indonesian language in just six months. his first grade teacher however disputes this and said he struggled with the language and his studies. although the school was catholic, barry soetoro as he was known then, was registered at the school as an indonesian citizen born in honolulu, hawaii and whose religion was listed as islam. [2] barry attended this school for three years until the family moved and he was enrolled in besuki primary school which was predominately muslim. it has mistakenly been described as a madrassa, however the school did teach the usual subjects including the quran. [3] private schooling and communist mentorann, barack and his sister maya moved back to hawaii and enrolled him in punahou school an elite private high school. [4] his mother returned to indonesia leaving obama to be raised by his white grandparents. in high school obama played basketball and admits in his memoir that he drank alcohol and used marijuana and cocaine. he made poor grades in his final high school years due to his drug use.[5] he found part-time employment working at a burger chain and at baskin-robbins. at the time one of obama’s acquaintances and close friend of his grandfather was frank marshall davis, a communist party member and sexual degenerate. davis and obama had something of a father-son relationship. college obama during his drug daysafter graduation from punahou, obama attended occidental college (september 1979 - june 1981) [6] a small liberal arts college in los angeles, california where he continued his cocaine use and played basketball. [7][8] most of his close friends and roommates were pakistani muslims. [9] at occidental, obama became involved in the anti-apartheid movement and divestment in white south africa. [10] in the summer of 1981 after graduating from occidental, obama and a pakistani roommate traveled to asia. they first visited obama’s mother and sister in indonesia. from there, obama and his companion traveled to karachi, pakistan and stayed with a friend’s family for three weeks. they later visited hyderabad in southern india. [11]later obama moved to new york city to attend columbia college, claiming to have studied political science and international relations. [12] the obama campaign has declined media requests to release his transcript at columbia or name anyone he knew who could give an interview concerning his college days. [13] few seem to have remembered him at columbia which has led to speculation he rarely attended classes. [14] one person obama knew in new york was sohale siddiqi, a drug addict and illegal immigrant from pakistan. obama and siddiqi would become roommates, living several blocks from the university.questions concerning obama’s "thesis" at columbia have remained as much of a mystery as his transcripts. on professor during his senior year claims the "thesis" or a paper written by obama exists but has been lost. michael baron a former professor at columbia’s political science department and an obama supporter remembers the paper to have been on the topic of soviet nuclear disarmament. [15] a new york times article claims his "thesis" was on the north-south debate concerning international trade. [16] the university has said at the time no thesis was necessary for graduation. employmentdirectly after graduating columbia, obama joined the corporate world and worked for one year at business international corporation as an editor in their business information division. business international (bi) was a newsletter publishing company assisting businesses operating abroad. [17] obama discussed his time at business international in his memoir in which he exaggerates his position at the firm. co-workers found him to be condescending.[18]in january, 1984 he joined the new york public interest research group a government reform organization started by ralph nader. obama became an organizer for city college in harlem working with student volunteers. [19] he was a campus organizer focused on waste management working to promote recycling instead of incineration of solid materials. he worked for three months in harlem and moved on to chicago as an organizer for the industrial areas foundation. [20] chicagoin chicago he worked as director for the developing communities project, a church-based social action group. [21] harvard law schoolafter four years in chicago as a community organizer, obama entered harvard law school in the fall of 1988. at harvard he was elected the first black president of the harvard law review and received his first national recognition. [22] until the 1970s, the choice ofpresident of harvard law review was based upon grades and achievement. the selection process was changed and entered the arena of politics and popularity to ensure minority participation. [23] even for a liberal university like harvard the choice of obama was controversial. the student editors of the review deliberated behind closed doors from 8:30 a.m. until early the next day. eventually they chose their first black president of harvard law review making their political statement. they were continuing an affirmative action tradition; obama as president would be replacing peter yu the first chinese-american president of harvard law review. barack obama never contributed an article to the publication he supposedly edited. also he failed to become a federal appeals court clerk which would have been routine for any harvard law review president. political activism obama in muslim attire during a trip to africafrom new york, obama went to chicago and became a community organizer. politically he moved in black militant and leftist circles. he joined trinity united church of christ, a radical black power church. he became a state legislator for illinois from 1997 to 2004, an office held by former radical alice palmer. he won the office with no opposition having his supporters to disqualify others who were on the ballot. [24]many of obama’s successes as a state legislator were pushed by senate president emil jones, jr. a powerful african-american member of the illinois senate who added obama’s name to proposed legislation. jones became the “king maker” and prepared obama for a run at the united states senate. a record 26 bills were passed giving obama credit for progressive legislation he would later use to propel himself to higher office. [25] many of the bills were passed in the final year of obama’s term as illinois state legislator.later barack obama ran for us congress against former black panther rep. bobby rush. rush would claim obama was an elitist and not black enough to represent the district. rush won with a 30 percentage point vote margin. [26]barack obama ran for the u.s. senate and won the election after several republican candidates dropped out of the election due to scandals. obama’s final republican opponent was alan keyes, a black religious conservative who once suggested jesus christ himself would vote against obama. [27]obama delivered the keynote address at the 2004 democratic national convention while still an illinois state legislator. he went on to win election to the u.s. senate in november 2004 with a landslide 70% of the vote in an election year marked by republican gains. as a member of the democratic minority in the 109th congress, obama co-sponsored the enactment of conventional weapons control and transparency legislation, and made official trips to eastern europe, the middle east, and africa. texas volunteers of the obama campaign with che guevara flag. obama speaking to aipac 2008 presidential electionon february 10, 2007, obama announced his candidacy for president of the united states in front of the old state capitol building in springfield, illinois. throughout the campaign, obama emphasized the issues of rapidly ending the iraq war, increasing energy independence, and providing universal health care.during both the primary process and the general election, obama's campaign set numerous fundraising records, particularly in the quantity of small donations. on june 19, obama became the first major-party presidential candidate to turn down public financing in the general election since the system was created in 1976.a large number of candidates initially entered the democratic party presidential primaries. after a few initial contests, the field narrowed to a contest between obama and senator hillary clinton, with each winning some states and with the race remaining nearly tied throughout the primary process. on june 3, with all states counted, obama passed the threshold to become the presumptive nominee. on that day, he gave a victory speech in st. paul, minnesota. clinton suspended her campaign and endorsed him on june 7. from that point on, he campaigned for the general election race against senator john mccain, the republican nominee.on august 23, 2008, obama selected delaware senator joe biden as his vice presidential running mate. at the democratic national convention in denver, colorado, obama's former rival hillary clinton gave a speech in support of obama's candidacy and later called for obama to be nominated by acclamation as the democratic presidential candidate. on august 28, obama delivered a speech to the 84,000 supporters in denver. during the speech, which was viewed by over 38 million people worldwide, he accepted his party's nomination and presented his policy goals.after mccain was nominated as the republican presidential candidate, there were three presidential debates between obama and mccain in september and october 2008. in november, obama won the presidency with 53% of the popular vote and a wide electoral college margin. obama and the jewsof the 11 current and former senior advisers of president barack obama, 9 are jews, partial jews, or have jewish spouses.[7]barack obama appears to have an evolving and/or conflicting attitude toward jews and israel. at a meeting in front of aipac in march 2012, obama claimed the concept of tikkun olam from kabbalistic judaism had "guided" his life. awarded the nobel peace prize in 2009, obama continued president bush's "war on terror" with drone strikes in pakistan and yemen. he also supported operation pillar of cloud israel's attack upon gaza resulting in the massacre of palestinian children. like most american politicians obama often repeats the phrase "israel has the right to defend itself."on january 7, 2013, shortly before the beginning of obama's second term, he nominated chuck hagel, a pro-obama former republican senator, from nebraska, to replace outgoing secretary of defense leon panetta, a surprisingly independent move. in a 2006 interview with aaron david miller, hagel famously said, "the jewish lobby intimidates a lot of people on capitol hill",[8] and "i’m not an israeli senator. i’m a united states senator,"[9] securing the ire of many lobby jews, though the jewish lobby j street and the neoconservative foreign policy were confident a hagel confirmation would mean little. a few days later obama nominated jack lew an orthodox jew and his former chief of staff to the secretary of the treasury. “ i've got a chief of staff named rahm israel emmanuel. my top political advisor is somebody who is a descendent of holocaust survivors. my closeness to the jewish american community was probably what propelled me to the u.s. senate. „ —barack obama, haaretz july 2010as evidence of how much the jews hate even their most loyal of lackeys, right after obama gave them $225 million us taxpayer dollars as a tribute in 2014, a poll conducted found that 43% of israelis want to send obama the ebola virus for his birthday.[10]in mind that in 2009, obama put jew tom frieden✡ in charge of the cdc where he remained throughout obama's two presidental terms. his presidency has seen the spread of rare african tropical diseases to the usa such as chik-v and ebola. work as presidentin 2006 he said, "raising america's debt limit is a sign of leadership failure." when he became president, he then raised that debt limit.[11]after going back on his promise for gm food labeling, he puts former monsanto vp michael r. taylor as head of the fda and then signs into law the monsanto protection act in 2013.in june 2013, during the same time when obama gave seven billion dollars to develop sub-saharan africa, he pays for this by cutting one of the three daily meals for us troops in afghanistan, the meal which is served hot.[12][13][14]july 5, 2013, obama quietly signed an order to give him all control of all private communications in the us in the name of national security.[15]after the acquittal of george zimmerman in july 2013, obama has launched a campaign to force racial integration into neighborhoods. he will punish american neighborhoods his government deems not “inclusive” enough. punishments will be dealt out via withholding federal funding to local and state governments found to be have too many white people.[16]his administration also requires stage magicians to submit 32-page disaster plans for their rabbits and get a license from the u.s. department of agriculture.[17]he is trying to ban criminal background checks because blacks commit more crime so criminal background checks are racist.[18][19] “ [al-qaeda] just want to live in peace with dignity and freedom. „ —president obama, on the 12th anniversary of the september 11th attacks[20]during the 2013 government shutdown, obama only shut down services that helped people and kept services that harmed people like the nsa fully active; he also kept all the luxuries for politicians going. what's worse is he spent billions of dollars to keep people out of public areas, including arresting people, during the shutdown. he spends millions of dollars and manpower removing well pumps along 184 mile of trails in public parks so people can't get water to drink. he also since he stopped funding people, he spent money and manpower kicking people out of their homes, far more money than simply funding them so they could have a home. he closed the national mall, but then opened it to hold a huge pro-demographic genocide rally funded by the taxpayer, as white genocide is deemed an essential service by the government.[21] a park service ranger even said, “we’ve been told to make life as difficult for people as we can. it’s disgusting.”[22]obamacare, his tax on the poor, has a hotline that is. 1-800-318-2596. phone digits are all assigned letters, except 1 which isn't. the letters 3,8,2,5,9 and 6 can be assigned f, c, k, y, and o. obamacare's number actually comes out to 1-800-3(f) 8(u) 2(c) 5(k) 9(y) 6(o) or 1-800-f-ck-you.[23]in october 2013, the military under his administration issued a 637-page manual that is required reading for military officers. it is about "white privilege" that says "assume racism is everywhere, every day". sample quote, “simply put, a healthy, white, heterosexual, christian male receives many unearned advantages of social privilege, whereas a black, homosexual, atheist female in poor health receives many unearned disadvantages of social privilege.” it was largely written by the criminal organization, the southern poverty law center.[24]he only honors negro soldiers on veteran's day.[25]in january 2014, after the disaster of obamacare, be said officially he blamed racism and not obamacare on his low approval ratings.[26]in june 2014, he expanded government benefits for homosexuals, transsexualism, and anyone with a sexual disorder.[27]obama asks for billions a month to give illegal aliens free immigration attorneys, welfare, and housing in order to give every illegal alien that crosses the border full amnesty and pay them for invading too.[28][29] he even buses the illegals to walmart, hands them ebt cards, and lets them shopping sprees, and then lets them stay in 5-star hotels--none of them are children, they're all adult men.[30] if the illegals have to have an immigration hearing, it is put off for at least three years.[31]in today's air travel in the usa, you must remove your shoes and walk around on the pandemic germ-filled floor in your socks for an hour as you stand in line. you must go through a cancer-causing nude body scanner or else you must get your genitals groped by people who don't change their gloves in between victims. and people who have contact lenses cannot bring their contact solutions with them; same goes for anyone else needing liquids for medical reasons. and it's a three hour wait through security and after all that, it hasn't stopped the main cause of death on airplanes: plane crashes. so in july 2014, in his hatred of the usa, president obama declared that all people in the usa illegally (the proper english term "illegal aliens" not "undocumented beings you must worship as gods") just have to print out a notice to appear form, which doesn't include a photo id and then get treated like royalty, being able to fly within the usa wherever they want and no security will stop them).[32][33]millions of people are homeless in the usa living in tent cities while obama spends millions a day to keep illegal aliens in the usa, to advertise to them, to import them through mexico, to give them welfare, etc.[34] obama also pays (with taxpayer money, never with his own money) $7,400 a month to anyone willing house illegal immigrants, but never homeless us citizens of course.[35]in his second term, obama rewrote the rules on the type of people the government is supposed to suspect as terrorists, with white people, the least likely group to commit terrorism. this was after decades of government refusal to racially profile middle eastern people as terrorists, which they still refuse to do. "the dhs suggests a typical woman terrorist would be a caucasian in her late 20s or early 30s, with brunette hair, stylish clothing, high heels and a shoulder bag. a man? about the same age, short hair, wearing a shirt and slacks and familiar with technology, as he’s wearing an earpiece cellphone. also caucasian."[36]he also has sent spy aircraft into russia and then when they were intercepted, illegally fled them into swedish airspace without permission.[37]during the height of the gaza holocaust of 2014, he approved $225 million taxpayer dollars sent to israel so they can continue to genocide children.[38]for his choices of united states secretary of the treasury, he chose stuart a. levey✡, timothy f. geithner, neal wolin✡, and then jack lew✡--three of which are confirmed jews. this is higher than bill clinton who chose lloyd m. bentsen, jr., frank n. newman, robert e. rubin✡, and then lawrence h. summers✡--the later two are confirmed jews. george w. bush chose paul h. o'neill, kenneth w. dam, john w. snow, robert m. kimmitt, and henry m. paulson--and none appear to be jews. thus, obama is the most jew-loving president out of these.obama also will despite the massive unemployment in the usa, constantly grant extra special work visas to millions of illegal alien mestizos every year. people like him and mark zuckerberg are fine with them stealing american jobs, but would never give up their homes, their jobs, and their money to mestizo aliens.[39]even during government shutdowns, he'll still push through citizenship for every illegal alien mestizo in the usa through the power of executive order.[40]in september 2014, he asked congress for $500 million more dollars to fund terrorist mercenaries (aka. fake "rebels") in syria.[41]besides mestizos, he also gives illegal immigrants from subsaharan africa all amnesty.[42]he has worked to ensure the spread of the ebola virus throughout the united states, earning him the nickname president ebola.in 2014, he announced that he will flood the usa with hundreds of thousands of negroes from haiti, who descended from the negroes who genocided all white people on the island in 1804.[43] senator chuck grassley said that this is part of a larger devious plot.[44] quotes “ we tortured some folks. ” —obama on august 1, 2014[45] “ big countries can't just stomp on little countries or force them to change their policies and give up their sovereignity. ” —ironic obama quote from september 2014[46] multimedia gallery president obama as tyrone in a shhhhheeeeeeeeiiiitt comic about the gaza holocaust. obama in muslim environment obama with his mother and his indonesian step father and sister barack obama with his mom barack obama and his family obama smokes obama and his wife on the cover of new yorker magazine obama with marx who can kiss finer? obama as a puppet of soros schwindler's list us presidential race obama was popular in africa. a negro wearing facial jewelry in support. a game of drones obama vs. the constitution this sums up us-israel relations. pretends to have sympathy obama embraced benjamin netanyahu. putin compared with obama. obama's differing views on gun control. donald trump accurately sums up obamacare. obama children's toy kim jong un compared with obama. obama is the first president to have a gang named after him. though they'll never do as many crimes or bring about as much physical violence as obama has. obama in 2013 vs. 2014 on obamacare barack obama doesn't care about the marines. weapons to mexico barack obama burns the us constitution. see also barack obama birth controversy list of barack obama's friends and roommates list of barack obama’s homosexual lovers barack obama’s communist connections barack obama's minority cabinet obama presidential logo family of barack obama frank marshall davis sohale siddiqi bill ayers dreams from my father rev. jeremiah a. wright, jr. roy obama larry sinclair saul alinsky references↑ the story of barack obama's mother↑ michelle: barry’s mom was “very young and very single when she had him”↑ secrets of obama family unlocked↑ old photos, new questions about obama nativity↑ old photos, new questions about obama nativity↑ new doubts revealed in obama's nativity story↑ comprehensive lists of the jews who dominate us at the daily stormer↑ jon swaine. chuck hagel 'to face questions' over israel views ahead of defence secretary nomination the daily telegraph. january 6, 2013.↑ yitzhak benhorin. us: hagel nomination irks pro-israel conservatives ynetnews. december 18, 2012.↑ obama gives himself control of all communication systems in america. july 9, 2012↑ punishments will be dealt out via withholding federal funding to local and state governments found to be just too darn by ulsterman on july 24, 2013↑ extreme hypocrisy! obama orders federal workers to “make life as difficult for people as we can”↑ obama asks for $500 million to train, equip syrian rebels↑ obama: big countries can't just stomp on little countries..
