he'd be better off smoking crack than passing obamacare. –jay leno it just came out that president obama brings a portable security tent with him on overseas trips so that he can read classified documents. he sets up a tent in his hotel room. obama said it's a good way to avoid being spied on while he keeps track of who he has spied on. –jimmy fallon obama said they've had some glitches with the affordable care website. i'll tell you something. if you order a pair of pants online and they send you the wrong color, that's a glitch. this is like a carnival cruise, for god's sake! today obama was in so much trouble he called hillary clinton and he said, 'could you start early?' –david letterman the president spoke today on the obamacare website glitches. he said he's bringing in the best and the brightest to solve the problem. why didn't he bring in the best and the brightest in the first place? see, this is typical washington. they only bring in the best and the brightest as a last resort. –jay leno in a speech today president obama called for a new era of bipartisan cooperation. he said this because obama likes to start off a speech with a joke.” –conan o'brien president obama said the day after the budget deal is made he's going to concentrate on immigration. he says he'll start by deporting ted cruz. –conan o'brien this is unbelievable. the government is shut down. even al qaeda couldn't do that. do you realize that? and as you know, all nonessential employees were sent home – like president obama's economic team. –jay leno if president obama really wants to hurt the syrian government, don't send cruise missiles. he should end over some of his economic advisers. –jay leno it should be in the dictionary: 'black-track,' the act of changing one's mind because president obama has agreed with you. see also: 'pulling a one-hatey,' or the 'kenyan boomerang.' –bill maher syria's president assad referred to president obama as weak. obama is so angry he plans to ask congress for permission to come up with a good comeback. –conan o'brien last night president obama spoke to the nation about syria. hopefully, americans who were confused about the president's plan feel better now, knowing that he's confused too. –jay leno this weekend president obama celebrated his 52nd birthday. for his birthday, michelle obama jumped out of a cake and told him he's not allowed to have any. –conan o'brien president obama celebrated his 52nd birthday yesterday. you can tell he's getting older because he no longer supports president obama. –jimmy fallon obama decided we're going to arm the rebels in syria. yes! this is why i voted for obama in the first place, so he could carry out mccain's bad ideas. –bill maher this is the same surveillance that was happening under bush, but under obama it's somehow a huge outrage on the right. republicans didn't care about big brother until we elected a big brotha. –bill maher according to a gallup poll, president obama's approval rating has dropped to 45 percent. luckily for obama, he has 'impeachment insurance.' it's called 'joe biden.' –jay leno another scandal hit the white house today. a report found that the government has been secretly collecting the phone records of verizon customers. i knew something was up when i said, 'you hang up first.' then my wife said, 'no, you hang up first!' then obama said, 'uh, how about you just hang up at the same time?' –jimmy fallon did you hear about this? the irs has admitted they were targeting conservative groups. president obama called it outrageous and said he would immediately have his benghazi investigators look into it. –jay leno some republicans are saying that due to his current scandals, president obama should be impeached. in response, obama laughed and said, 'two words fellas: president biden.' --conan o'brien people always say this to me: 'hey, letterman,' they say. 'why don't you make jokes about obama?' all right, i'll tell you why. i don't make jokes about him because i don't want the fbi tapping my phone, that's why. --david letterman president obama will be sworn in with his hand resting on two bibles. is that how screwed up washington is now? one bible can't get the job done anymore? –jay leno the white house announced today that the theme for president obama's second inauguration will be 'faith in america's future.' the idea is to get our minds off of america's present. –jay leno president obama's inauguration is coming up. during next week's inauguration, he will be sworn in with not one, but two bibles. relax, mr. president. we get it. you're not a muslim. you're overcompensating. –conan o'brien president obama recently came under fire over the lack of diversity in his cabinet. then obama said, 'you guys know i'll be there, too, right?' –jimmy fallon the white house announced that the theme for president obama's inauguration will be 'faith in america's future.' which is proof that no one in the white house has ever seen 'here comes honey boo boo.' –jimmy fallon congratulations to president obama on being reelected president of the united states. turns out it is not all bad news for the republicans. it seems that depression is covered by obamacare. –jay leno i knew obama was going to win. i knew this little secret. use it next time there is an election and see if it doesn't work out. the guy who wins the presidential election is usually the guy who kills bin laden. –david letterman president obama easily won his home state of illinois. in fact, in chicago obama got 120 percent of the vote. –jay leno exit polls show that president obama did well with women, beating romney by 11 binders. –jay leno in his victory speech last night, president obama told his daughters that they would not be getting another dog. when asked why, the president said, 'because i just made mitt romney my bitch. –conan o'brien well, finally the long race is over and as usual a guy from kenya won. –david letterman folks, it's one week before the election, and chris christie is praising a democrat. what’s next, a democrat praising christie? it’s unnatural; it’s like kissing your sister. which, by the way, would be federal law if obama is elected. –stephen colbert donald trump said he'd give $5 million to charity if president obama released his college transcripts. obama responded by sending trump a full transcript from his alma mater, the university of shove it up your ass. –conan o'brien president obama flew to a rally in las vegas last night. however, he did not visit any of the casinos. you know why? when you're $16 trillion in debt, they don't let you in. –jay leno today colin powell endorsed barack obama for president. this news surprised many elderly americans who thought they were the same person. –craig ferguson one of president obama's winning points last night was about how sanctions against iran are crippling their economy. and believe me, if anyone knows how to cripple an economy, it's president obama. –jay leno tonight president obama and mitt romney hold their final debate in boca raton, florida. the topic of the debate is what is more shocking to see in boca raton, a mormon or a black guy. –conan o'brien tonight president obama and mitt romney debate foreign policy. pundits say it will be close, but it will probably go to the candidate who wore the 'i killed osama bin laden' t-shirt. –conan o'brien so far for halloween, sales of obama masks are 30 percent higher than the sales of mitt romney masks. that makes sense. i mean, what's scarier than four more years of this economy? –jay leno tonight is the third and final presidential debate between former governor mitt romney and future former president barack obama. now i'm tivoing it, so nobody tell me whether the moderate or conservative romney kicked the lethargic or energetic obama's ass. –stephen colbert obama is still ahead in the swing states and among women. he is of course losing among men and in any states were you can buy the confederate flag in a mall. -bill maher endorsements are rolling in. the atheist party has endorsed obama for president. when told the news obama said, 'thank god.' –conan o'brien a cnn poll today said that 46 percent of viewers who watched thought obama won and 39 percent thought mitt romney won. so, it looks like obama's strategy of staying awake through this one paid off. –jimmy kimmel one of president obama's goals tonight is to win back female voters. which explains why obama is going to answer every question with a passage from 'fifty shades of grey.' –conan o'brien the obama campaign is releasing a new ad showing americans whose financial situation has improved over the past four years. unfortunately, the only person who appears in the ad is mitt romney. –conan o'brien this week president obama's facebook page received more than a million 'likes' in a single day. all of them from republicans who watched last week's debate. –jimmy fallon you know the obama campaign's in trouble when they're looking to joe biden to turn things around. –david letterman the good news for the white house is that unemployment has dropped to 7.8 percent, right where it was when president obama took office. so obama has gone from 'change you can believe in' to 'can you believe there's no change.' –jay leno this week the obamas' dog, bo, turned 4 years old. he spent the day the way he always does – digging holes, chasing squirrels, and coaching obama for the debates. –jimmy fallon apparently after last week's debate, polls show obama trailing romney by one point. one point — or as it's also known, 'the thing obama failed to make during last week's debate.' –jimmy fallon democrats are accusing mitt romney of cheating during the debate. i don't know who he cheated off of, but i think we can rule out president obama. –jay leno obama's wedding anniversary was wednesday and that was the same day as the debate. he apparently ahd the sex first and was completely spent, had nothing left. –bill maher romney looked like the big winner, and obama looked like the big lebowski. now we know what romney looks like when he is all charged up. and now we know what michael jackson looks like on diprivan.....i have not seen a black man look that disinterested and annoyed since i dragged chris rock to that beach boys concert. at one point obama looked do dead, romney tried to baptize him. –bill maher it's like obama wasn't even there. he hasn't done this poorly since he debated clint eastwood. –stephen colbert they say close to 60 million people may have watched the debate. in fact, the only person who didn't tune in was president obama. what happened? –jay leno president obama talked last night about finding new sources of energy. he couldn’t muster enough energy for the 90-minute debate. and to make matters worse, last night was his anniversary. the only way his wedding anniversary could have been worse was if he had forgotten it. –jay leno a lot of people disappointed in president obama's performance last night. last night, critics say president obama spent too much time looking down at something on the podium. and today the president apologized and said, 'at the next debate, no more angry birds.' –conan o'brien tonight was the first presidential debate between barack obama and mitt romney. not only that, it was also obama's 20th wedding anniversary. it was a little weird during the debate when obama promised to balance the budget, lower taxes, and be home by 10:00 for cuddle time. –jimmy fallon president obama is so confident that he's thinking about letting joe biden start speaking again. –jay leno well, last week in vermont, the guy from the dos equis beer commercials -- you know the most interesting man in the world -- he hosted a fundraiser for president obama. see, that shows you how things have changed. four years ago the slogan was hope and change. now it’s 'stay thirsty my friends.' –jay leno mitt romney said the 47 percent of people who don't pay taxes are going to vote for obama. you know what that means? he's going to vote for obama. –jay leno a new poll shows that after the democratic national convention, president obama got a four-point bounce in the polls, which means that's he's now only five points behind bill clinton. –seth meyers obama joked this week that bill clinton, who has been campaigning for him, should be appointed to the role of secretary of explaining stuff. hey, you know what's another good name for that position? president. –seth meyers when it came to 'hope' and 'change' president obama told the crowd, 'you were the change.' and then the crowd said, 'hey don't blame us. you were supposed to be the change! i just voted. why is it my fault?' –jay leno it is day two of the democratic convention, and apparently they had a huge lighting problem in the convention hall today. they worked all day on it. they still couldn't get president obama out of bill clinton's shadow. –jay leno the stoner comedy duo harold and kumar are starring in a new promo for the democratic convention alongside president obama, which is pretty impressive. the only other person to go from smoking pot with buddies to the white house is president obama. –jay leno on saturday the white house released president obama's personal recipe for a home-brewed beer. that's how bad the economy is. not only is our president drinking, he's drinking beer he made in his bathtub. –jimmy kimmel i could never wrap my head around why the world and the president that republicans describe, bear so little resemblance to the world and the president that i experience. and now i know why. there is a president obama that only republicans can see. –jon stewart on clint eastwood's invisible obama speech at the republican convention a man in florida has been arrested for wearing a president obama mask while robbing a mcdonald's. to show you how good this guy's disguise was, instead of a holdup note he was reading from a teleprompter. –jay leno this obama robber made some pretty scary threats to the mcdonald's employees. he said, 'give me your money, or else my economic plan will have you working here for the rest of your life.' –jay leno according to the new york times, more than half of president obama's twitter followers are fake. they don't even exist. which is actually a good thing because if they did exist there wouldn't be any jobs for them. –jay leno yesterday a medical marijuana group officially endorsed president obama for president. doesn't really help obama though, because they were just getting around to endorsing him for 2008. –conan o'brien president obama is brewing his own beer in the white house. actually, the white house beer is a lot like the obama administration – great buzz, weak finish. –jay leno mitt romney is predicting that as president, he will create 12 million jobs in his first term. well, president obama says a romney presidency would result in lost jobs. yeah, his and biden's. –jay leno president obama said today he is sticking with joe biden. which means one of two things – either he thinks biden is doing a good job or hillary said no. –jay leno president obama met with treasury secretary timothy geithner in the oval office. they agreed on a new economic plan after losing last night's big powerball lottery. –jay leno president obama is still reminding people that he inherited this economy. let me tell you something. if this economy doesn't turn around soon, his inheritance could be cut off in november. –jay leno according to a new book coming out by a pulitzer prize-winning author, apparently when he was in high school, president obama smoked large amounts of marijuana. you know what that means? he could be our first green president. –jay leno president obama admitted this week that a former girlfriend that he wrote about in his autobiography was made up and not a real person . . . so obama had an imaginary girlfriend. big deal! he had an imaginary economic plan. it’s all the same. –jay leno it's weird to me what obama chose to fabricate in his memoir. it wasn't something cool he made up, like hitting six home runs in a little league game, or faking his own birth certificate. no, it was something lame. he just compressed the details of several girlfriends into one character. i'm thinking, oh, very smooth. because if there's one thing i know that women love, it's being blurred together with other women. –craig ferguson i hosted the white house correspondents' association dinner on saturday night. the entertainment was me and president obama. he was very funny, and made jokes about the fact that he ate a dog. some people thought it was undignified for the president to joke about that. personally, i feel like once you eat a dog, dignity is pretty much out the window. get what you can out of it. –jimmy kimmel president obama has revealed his new re-election slogan — 'forward.' that's a good message for obama. he's telling voters, 'whatever you do, don't look back at all those campaign promises i made.' –jay leno conservatives are now criticizing president obama because as a child in indonesia he sometimes ate dog meat. but on the plus side, obama is now polling very well among cats. –conan o'brien president obama, in his memoir, talked about his childhood in indonesia living with his stepfather. he said when he was 8 years old, his stepfather introduced him to a number of unusual meats, including dog. our president ate dog. not only that, according to the book, he also ate snake. and his mother was looking for tiger. he was eating through noah's ark. –jimmy kimmel but the dog thing — maybe that is where the floppy ears come from. –jimmy kimmel president obama released his tax returns. it turns out he made $900,000 less in 2011 then he did in 2010. you know what that means? even obama is doing worse under president obama. –jay leno it's not a good week for president obama either. his approval rating has dropped 9% in the last month to an all-time low of 41%. it was 57% last may. in fact, if this keeps up, the white house says they may have to fish out bin laden and shoot him all over again. –jay leno one by one the republican candidate potentials have been shooting themselves in the foot making huge, horrible gaffes and they just look silly. it's gotten so bad that president obama is now worried he may actually be re-elected. –david letterman next more obama jokes share with a friend ~compiled by daniel kurtzman follow political humor on facebook, twitter and google+ previousnext12345 related articlesobama campaign jokesobama scandal jokesobama inauguration jokesobama inauguration jokes15 best obama jokes from 'the tonight show with jay leno' our expert recommends best obama jokes of all time obama joke pictures obama political cartoons latest late-night jokes best jokes of the year sarah palin jokes political cartoons of the week funniest pictures of all time funny political protest signs political humor essentials political cartoons of the week political cartoons latest late-night jokes late night jokes funny barack obama pictures barack obama jokes funny political protest signs funny pictures and memes funny political bumper stickers funny political bumper stickers entertainment slideshows 100 greatest rap songs rap/hip-hop 10 must read romance novels for november romance novels where are they now: 'full house' stars tv comedies the 10 best concert halls in the world classical music the 100 most popular suspense movies of all time horror movies readers recommendphotos of obama being awesome - funny and cool obama photosfunniest political protest signs of all time - funny political signslate night political jokes - late night jokes updated dailydumbest political quotes of all time - stupid political quotespolitical cartoons of the week more from the web powered by zergnet about.com about entertainment political humor hot political issues and scandals election humor 2008 presidential election jokes barack obama jokes about entertainmentfollow us: we deliver. get the best ofabout entertainment in your inbox. please enter a valid email address. did you mean ?
