head, neck, and joint pain; and generalized muscle pain. the lesion will resolve without treatment in about a month.weeks to months later the bacterium can affect the joints, heart, and nervous system.the late phase of lyme disease can also affect the joints, heart, and nervous system. in the heart, there can be an abnormal heart rhythm. the face can become paralyzed (facial muscle paralysis), and you can have confusion and abnormal sensations of the skin such as numbness, tingling, a prickling sensation, or pain. there can be inflammation in the joints, or arthritis, beginning with swelling, stiffness, and pain, commonly affecting the knees. self-care guidelines if you suspect you have had a tick bite and may have contracted lyme disease, call your doctor. if you have found a tick on your skin and removed it, you may want to save the tick in a small container of alcohol so that it can be used for identification.ticks begin transmitting lyme disease about 2448 hours after attaching to the host. you can reduce your chances of getting lyme disease by removing the tick within 48 hours.to remove the tick, you will need tweezers and isopropyl alcohol.sterilize the tweezers with alcohol, and make sure to wash your hands. you should not clean or disturb the skin near the tick. grasp the part of the tick that is embedded in the skin with the tweezers, not the body where you may see tiny legs. the tick will likely be firmly embedded. pull it outward in one motion. do not twist or jerk the tweezers. do not apply anything to the tick that you think may help it come out smoothly as this may result in a part of the tick being left in the skin. clean the bite wound with alcohol. if you are not sure if the entire tick has been removed, see your doctor.observe the bitten area for the appearance of a rash for up to a month after the bite. it is probably best to call your doctor for further guidance if you think you have been bitten by a tick. if a rash or other early symptoms of lyme disease develop, see a physician immediately. when to seek medical care it is probably best to call your doctor for further guidance if you think you have been bitten by a tick. if a rash or other early symptoms of lyme disease develop, see a physician immediately. treatments your physician may prescribe lyme disease can be treated and cured with one of several oral antibiotics for 34 weeks. the skin rash will go away within a few days of beginning treatment, but other symptoms may persist for up to a few weeks. in severe cases of lyme disease where the nervous system is involved, the antibiotic may need to be given intravenously. in late stage lyme disease, symptoms may not go away completely, but should improve. referencesbolognia, jean l., ed. dermatology, pp. 1138-1139. new york: mosby, 2003.wolff, klaus, ed. fitzpatrick's dermatology in general medicine. 7th ed., pp. 1797-1806. new york: mcgraw-hill, 2008. last updated: 29 sep 2010 information for other ages: child teen table of contents: overview who's at risk signs and symptoms self-care guidelines when to seek medical care treatments your provider may prescribe references/trusted links related diseases: granuloma annulare ringworm (tinea corporis) view all diseases community: discussion forum skinmatters blog about us | terms of use | contact us 2006-2013 logical images, inc. all rights reserved. advertising notice this site and third parties who place advertisements on this site may collect and use information about your visits to this site and other websites in order to provide advertisements about goods and services of interest to you. if you would like to obtain more information about these advertising practices and to make choices about online behavioral advertising, please click here. this site complies with the honcode standard for trustworthy health information: verify here. logical images, inc. all rights reserved. use of this site constitutes acceptance of skinsight's terms of service and privacy policy. the material on this site is for informational purposes only, and is not a substitute for medical advice, diagnosis or treatment provided by a qualified health care provider.
