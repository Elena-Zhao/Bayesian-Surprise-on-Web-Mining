long lasting, disease that causes inflammation—irritation or swelling—in the gastrointestinal (gi) tract. most commonly, crohn's affects the small intestine and the beginning of the large intestine. however, the disease can affect any part of the gi tract, from the mouth to the anus.crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the gi tract, called inflammatory bowel disease (ibd). ulcerative colitis and microscopic colitis are the other common ibds. read more in ulcerative colitis and microscopic colitis: collagenous colitis and lymphocytic colitis at disease most often begins gradually and can become worse over time. most people have periods of remission—times when symptoms disappear—that can last for weeks or years.some people with crohn's disease receive care from a gastroenterologist, a doctor who specializes in digestive diseases.[top]what is the gastrointestinal tract?the gi tract is a series of hollow organs joined in a long, twisting tube from the mouth to the anus—a 1-inch-long opening through which stool leaves the body. the body digests food using the movement of muscles in the gi tract, along with the release of hormones and enzymes. organs that make up the gi tract are the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, large intestine—which includes the appendix, cecum, colon, and rectum—and anus. the last part of the gi tract—called the lower gi tract—consists of the large intestine and anus. the intestines are sometimes called the bowel.the gi tract[top]what causes crohn's disease?the exact cause of crohn's diseaseis unknown. researchers believe thefollowing factors may play a role in causingcrohn's disease:autoimmune reactiongenesenvironmentautoimmune reaction. scientists believeone cause of crohn's disease may be anautoimmune reaction—when a person'simmune system attacks healthy cells in thebody by mistake. normally, the immunesystem protects the body from infection byidentifying and destroying bacteria, viruses,and other potentially harmful foreignsubstances. researchers believe bacteria orviruses can mistakenly trigger the immunesystem to attack the inner lining of theintestines. this immune system responsecauses the inflammation, leading tosymptoms.genes. crohn's disease sometimes runs infamilies. research has shown that peoplewho have a parent or sibling with crohn'sdisease may be more likely to develop thedisease. researchers continue to study thelink between genes and crohn's disease.environment. some studies suggestthat certain things in the environmentmay increase the chance of a persongetting crohn's disease, although theoverall chance is low. nonsteroidalanti-inflammatory drugs,1 antibiotics,2 andoral contraceptives2 may slightly increasethe chance of developing crohn's disease.a high-fat diet may also slightly increasethe chance of getting crohn's disease.3some people incorrectly believe that eatingcertain foods, stress, or emotional distresscan cause crohn's disease. emotionaldistress and eating certain foods do notcause crohn's disease. sometimes thestress of living with crohn's disease canmake symptoms worse. also, some peoplemay find that certain foods can trigger orworsen their symptoms.1ananthakrishnan an, higuchi lm, huang es,et al. aspirin, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory druguse, and risk for crohn's disease and ulcerativecolitis: a cohort study.

arediarrheaabdominal cramping and painweight lossother general signs and symptoms includefeeling tirednausea or loss of appetitefeveranemia—a condition in which the bodyhas fewer red blood cells than normalsigns and symptoms of inflammation outsideof the intestines includejoint pain or sorenesseye irritationskin changes that involve red, tenderbumps under the skinthe symptoms a person experiences canvary depending on the severity of theinflammation and where it occurs.[top]how is crohn's disease diagnosed?a health care provider diagnoses crohn'sdisease with the following:medical and family historyphysical examlab testsupper gi seriescomputerized tomography (ct) scanintestinal endoscopythe health care provider may perform aseries of medical tests to rule out otherbowel diseases, such as irritable bowelsyndrome, ulcerative colitis, or celiacdisease, that cause symptoms similar to thoseof crohn's disease. read more about theseconditions at and family historytaking a medical and family history canhelp a health care provider diagnosecrohn's disease and understand a patient'ssymptoms. he or she will ask the patient todescribe his or herfamily historysymptomscurrent and past medical conditionscurrent medicationsphysical exama physical exam may help diagnose crohn'sdisease. during a physical exam, the healthcare provider most oftenchecks for abdominal distension, orswellinglistens to sounds within the abdomenusing a stethoscopetaps on the abdomen to check fortenderness and pain and establish if theliver or spleen is abnormal or enlargedlab testsa health care provider may order lab tests,including blood and stool tests.blood tests. a blood test involves drawingblood at a health care provider's office or alab. a lab technologist will analyze the bloodsample. a health care provider may useblood tests to look for changes inred blood cells. when red blood cellsare fewer or smaller than normal, apatient may have anemia.white blood cells. when the whiteblood cell count is higher than normal,a person may have inflammation orinfection somewhere in his or her body.stool tests. a stool test is the analysis ofa sample of stool. a health care providerwill give the patient a container for catchingand storing the stool at home. the patientreturns the sample to the health careprovider or to a lab. a lab technologistwill analyze the stool sample. health careproviders commonly order stool tests to ruleout other causes of gi diseases.upper gastrointestinal seriesan upper gi series, also called a bariumswallow, uses x-rays and fluoroscopy to helpdiagnose problems of the upper gi tract.fluoroscopy is a form of x-ray that makesit possible to see the internal organs andtheir motion on a video monitor. an x-raytechnician performs this test at a hospital oran outpatient center, and a radiologist—adoctor who specializes in medical imaging—interprets the images.this test does not require anesthesia. apatient should not eat or drink before theprocedure, as directed by the health careprovider. patients should ask their healthcare provider about how to prepare for anupper gi series.during the procedure, the patient will standor sit in front of an x-ray machine and drinkbarium, a chalky liquid. barium coats theesophagus, stomach, and small intestine sothe radiologist and a health care providercan see the shape of these organs moreclearly on x-rays.a patient may experience bloating andnausea for a short time after the test. forseveral days afterward, barium liquid inthe gi tract causes white or light-coloredstools. a health care provider will give thepatient specific instructions about eating anddrinking after the test.computerized tomography scancomputerized tomography scans usea combination of x-rays and computertechnology to create images. for a ctscan, a health care provider may give thepatient a solution to drink and an injectionof a special dye, called contrast medium.ct scans require the patient to lie on a tablethat slides into a tunnel-shaped device wherethe x-rays are taken. an x-ray technicianperforms the procedure in an outpatientcenter or a hospital, and a radiologistinterprets the images. the patient does notneed anesthesia. ct scans can diagnose bothcrohn's disease and the complications seenwith the disease.intestinal endoscopyintestinal endoscopies are the most accuratemethods for diagnosing crohn's disease andruling out other possible conditions, suchas ulcerative colitis, diverticular disease, orcancer. intestinal endoscopies includeupper gi endoscopy and enteroscopycapsule endoscopycolonoscopyupper gi endoscopy and enteroscopy. anupper gi endoscopy is a procedure that usesan endoscope—a small, flexible tube witha light—to directly visualize the lining ofthe upper gi tract. a health care providerperforms the procedure at a hospital or anoutpatient center. a nurse or technician maygive the patient a liquid anesthetic to gargleor will spray the anesthetic on the back of apatient's throat. the anesthetic numbs thethroat and calms the gag reflex. the nurseor technician will then place an intravenous(iv) needle in the person's arm or hand toprovide a sedative. the health care providercarefully feeds the endoscope down thepatient's esophagus and into the stomach.a small camera on the endoscope sends avideo image to a monitor, allowing closeexamination of the gi tract.during an enteroscopy, the health careprovider examines the small intestine with aspecial, longer endoscope. the health careprovider carefully feeds the endoscope intothe small intestine using one of the followingprocedures:push enteroscopy, which uses a longendoscope to examine the upper portionof the small intestinesingle- or double-balloon enteroscopy,which use small balloons to help movethe endoscope into the small intestinespiral enteroscopy, which uses a tubeattached to an endocope that acts as acork screw to move the instrument intothe small intestinethe procedure most often takes between15 and 60 minutes. the endoscope doesnot interfere with the patient's breathing,and many patients fall asleep during theprocedure.capsule endoscopy. although this procedurecan examine the entire digestive tract, healthcare providers use it mostly to examinethe small intestine. the patient swallowsa capsule containing a tiny camera. as thecapsule passes through the gi tract, thecamera will record and transmit images toa small receiver device worn by the patient.when the recording is done, the health careprovider downloads the images and reviewsthem on a video monitor. the cameracapsule leaves the patient's body during abowel movement and is safely flushed downthe toilet.colonoscopy. colonoscopy is a test that usesa long, flexible, narrow tube with a light andtiny camera on one end, called a colonoscopeor scope, to look inside a patient's rectumand entire colon. in most cases, lightanesthesia and pain medication help patientsrelax for the test. the medical staff willmonitor a patient's vital signs and try tomake him or her as comfortable as possible.a nurse or technician will place an iv needlein a vein in the patient's arm or hand to giveanesthesia.for the test, the patient will lie on a tableor stretcher while the gastroenterologistinserts a colonoscope into the patient's anusand slowly guides it through the rectumand into the colon. the scope inflatesthe large intestine with air to give thegastroenterologist a better view. the camerasends a video image of the intestinal liningto a monitor, allowing the gastroenterologistto examine the tissues lining the colon andrectum. the gastroenterologist may movethe patient several times and adjust thescope for better viewing. once the scope hasreached the opening to the small intestine,the gastroenterologist slowly withdraws itand examines the lining of the colon andrectum again.a colonoscopy can show inflamed andswollen tissue, ulcers, and abnormal growthssuch as polyps––extra pieces of tissue thatgrow on the inner lining of the intestine.if the gastroenterologist suspects crohn'sdisease, he or she will biopsy the patient'scolon and rectum. a biopsy is a procedurethat involves taking small pieces of tissue forexamination with a microscope.a health care provider will give patientswritten bowel prep instructions to followat home before the test. the health careprovider will also give patients informationabout how to care for themselves followingthe procedure.[top]how is crohn's disease treated?a health care provider treats crohn's diseasewithmedicationsbowel restsurgerywhich treatment a person needs dependson the severity of the disease and symptoms.each person experiences crohn's diseasedifferently, so health care providers adjusttreatments to improve the person's symptomsand induce, or bring about, remission.medicationswhile no medication cures crohn's disease,many can reduce symptoms. the goals ofmedication therapy areinducing and maintaining remissionimproving the person's quality of lifemany people with crohn's disease requiremedication therapy. health care providerswill prescribe medications depending on theperson's symptoms:aminosalicylatescorticosteroidsimmunomodulatorsbiologic therapiesother medicationsaminosalicylates are medications thatcontain 5-aminosalicyclic acid (5-asa),which helps control inflammation. healthcare providers use aminosalicylates to treatpeople newly diagnosed with crohn's diseasewho have mild symptoms. aminosalicylatesincludebalsalazidemesalamineolsalazinesulfasalazine—a combination ofsulfapyridine and 5-asasome of the common side effects ofaminosalicylates includeabdominal paindiarrheaheadachesheartburnnausea and vomitingcorticosteroids, also known as steroids,help reduce the activity of the immunesystem and decrease inflammation. healthcare providers prescribe corticosteroids forpeople with moderate to severe symptoms.corticosteroids includebudesonidehydrocortisonemethylprednisoneprednisoneside effects of corticosteroids includeacnea higher chance of developing infectionsbone mass losshigh blood glucosehigh blood pressuremood swingsweight gainin most cases, health care providers do notprescribe corticosteroids for long-term use.immunomodulators reduce immune systemactivity, resulting in less inflammation inthe gi tract. these medications can takeseveral weeks to 3 months to start working.immunomodulators include6-mercaptopurine, or 6-mpazathioprinecyclosporinemethotrexatehealth care providers prescribe thesemedications to help people with crohn'sdisease go into remission or to help peoplewho do not respond to other treatments.people taking these medications may havethe following side effects:a low white blood cell count, whichcan lead to a higher chance ofinfectionfatigue, or feeling tirednausea and vomitingpancreatitishealth care providers most oftenprescribe cyclosporine only to people withsevere crohn's disease because of themedication's serious side effects. peopleshould talk with their health care providerabout the risks and benefits of cyclosporine.biologic therapies are medications thattarget a protein made by the immunesystem. neutralizing this protein decreasesinflammation in the intestine. biologictherapies work quickly to bring onremission, especially in people who do notrespond to other medications. biologictherapies includeadalimumabcertolizumabinfliximabnatalizumabvedolizumabhealth care providers most often givepatients infliximab every 6 to 8 weeks ata hospital or an outpatient center. sideeffects may include a toxic reaction tothe medication and a higher chanceof developing infections, particularlytuberculosis.other medications to treat symptoms orcomplications may includeacetaminophen for mild pain. peoplewith crohn's disease should avoid usingibuprofen, naproxen, and aspirin sincethese medications can make symptomsworse.antibiotics to prevent or treat infectionsand fistulas.loperamide to help slow or stop severediarrhea. in most cases, people onlytake this medication for short periodsof time since it can increase the chanceof developing megacolon.bowel restsometimes crohn's disease symptoms aresevere and a person may need to rest his orher bowel for a few days to several weeks.bowel rest involves drinking only clearliquids or having no oral intake. to providethe patient with nutrition, a health careprovider will deliver iv nutrition through aspecial catheter, or tube, inserted into a veinin the patient's arm. some patients stay inthe hospital, while other patients are ableto receive the treatment at home. in mostcases, the intestines are able to heal duringbowel rest.surgeryeven with medication treatments, up to20 percent of people will need surgery totreat their crohn's disease.1 althoughsurgery will not cure crohn's disease, it cantreat complications and improve symptoms.health care providers most often recommendsurgery to treatfistulasbleeding that is life threateningbowel obstructionsside effects from medications when theythreaten a person's healthsymptoms when medications do notimprove a person's conditiona surgeon can perform different types ofoperations to treat crohn's disease:small bowel resectionsubtotal colectomyproctocolectomy and ileostomypatients will receive general anesthesia.most patients will stay in the hospital for 3 to7 days after the surgery. full recovery maytake 4 to 6 weeks.small bowel resection. small bowel resectionis surgery to remove part of a patient's smallintestine. when a patient with crohn'sdisease has a blockage or severe disease inthe small intestine, a surgeon may need toremove that section of intestine. the twotypes of small bowel resection arelaparoscopic—when a surgeon makesseveral small, half-inch incisions in thepatient's abdomen. the surgeon insertsa laparoscope—a thin tube with a tinylight and video camera on the end—through the small incisions. the camerasends a magnified image from insidethe body to a video monitor, giving thesurgeon a close-up view of the smallintestine. while watching the monitor,the surgeon inserts tools through thesmall incisions and removes the diseasedor blocked section of small intestine.the surgeon will reconnect the ends ofthe intestine.open surgery—when a surgeon makesone incision about 6 inches long inthe patient's abdomen. the surgeonwill locate the diseased or blockedsection of small intestine and removeor repair that section. the surgeon willreconnect the ends of the intestine.subtotal colectomy. a subtotal colectomy,also called a large bowel resection, is surgeryto remove part of a patient's large intestine.when a patient with crohn's disease hasa blockage, a fistula, or severe disease inthe large intestine, a surgeon may need toremove that section of intestine. a surgeoncan perform a subtotal colectomy bylaparoscopic colectomy—when asurgeon makes several small, half-inchincisions in the abdomen. whilewatching the monitor, the surgeonremoves the diseased or blocked sectionof the large intestine. the surgeon willreconnect the ends of the intestine.open surgery—when a surgeon makesone incision about 6 to 8 inches long inthe abdomen. the surgeon will locatethe diseased or blocked section of smallintestine and remove that section. thesurgeon will reconnect the ends of theintestine.proctocolectomy and ileostomy. aproctocolectomy is surgery to remove apatient's entire colon and rectum. anileostomy is a stoma, or opening in theabdomen, that a surgeon creates from a partof the ileum—the last section of the smallintestine. the surgeon brings the end of theileum through an opening in the patient'sabdomen and attaches it to the skin, creatingan opening outside of the patient's body.the stoma is about three-fourths of an inchto a little less than 2 inches wide and ismost often located in the lower part of thepatient's abdomen, just below the beltline.a removable external collection pouch,called an ostomy pouch or ostomy appliance,connects to the stoma and collects intestinalcontents outside the patient's body.intestinal contents pass through the stomainstead of passing through the anus. thestoma has no muscle, so it cannot controlthe flow of intestinal contents, and theflow occurs whenever peristalsis occurs.peristalsis is the movement of the organwalls that propels food and liquid throughthe gi tract.people who have this type of surgery willhave the ileostomy for the rest of their lives.ileostomy[top]eating, diet, and nutritionresearchers have not found that eating,diet, and nutrition cause crohn's diseasesymptoms. good nutrition is important inthe management of crohn's disease, however.dietary changes can help reduce symptoms.a health care provider may recommend thata person make dietary changes such asavoiding carbonated drinksavoiding popcorn, vegetable skins, nuts,and other high-fiber foodsdrinking more liquidseating smaller meals more oftenkeeping a food diary to help identifytroublesome foodshealth care providers may recommendnutritional supplements and vitamins forpeople who do not absorb enough nutrients.to help ensure coordinated and safecare, people should discuss their use ofcomplementary and alternative medicalpractices, including their use of dietarysupplements and probiotics, with theirhealth care provider. read more on a person's symptoms ormedications, a health care provider mayrecommend a specific diet, such as ahigh-calorie dietlactose-free dietlow-fat dietlow-fiber dietlow-salt dietpeople should speak with a healthcare provider about specific dietaryrecommendations and changes.[top]what are the complications of crohn's disease?complications of crohn's disease can includebowel obstruction. crohn's diseasecan thicken the wall of the intestine.over time, the thickened areas of theintestine can narrow, which can blockthe intestine. a partial or completeobstruction, also called a bowelblockage, can block the movement offood or stool through the intestines.a complete bowel obstruction is lifethreatening and requires immediatemedical attention and often surgery.fistulas—abnormal passages, ortunnels, between two organs, orbetween an organ and the outside ofthe body. how a health care providertreats fistulas depends on their type andseverity. for some people, fistulas healwith medication and diet changes, whileother people will need to have surgery.anal fissures—small tears in theanus that may cause itching, pain,or bleeding. most anal fissures healwith medical treatment, includingointments, warm baths, and dietarychanges.ulcers. inflammation anywhere alongthe gi tract can lead to ulcers or opensores in a person's mouth, intestines,anus, and perineum—the area betweenthe anus and the sex organs. in mostcases, the treatment a health careprovider prescribes for crohn's diseasewill also treat the ulcers.malnutrition—a condition thatdevelops when the body does not getthe right amount of vitamins, minerals,and nutrients it needs to maintainhealthy tissues and organ function.some people may need iv fluids orfeeding tubes to replace lost nutrientsand fluids.inflammation in other areas of thebody. the immune system can triggerinflammation in the joints eyes skin health care providers can treat inflammationby adjusting medications or prescribing newmedications.[top]crohn's disease and colon cancerpeople with crohn's disease in thelarge intestine may be more likely todevelop colon cancer. people whoreceive ongoing treatment and remainin remission may reduce their chancesof developing colon cancer.people with crohn's disease should talkwith their health care provider abouthow often they should get screened forcolon cancer. screening can includecolonoscopy with biopsies. suchscreening does not reduce a person'schances of developing colon cancer.instead, screening can help diagnosecancer early and improve chances forrecovery.[top]points to remember crohn's disease is a chronic, orlong lasting, disease that causesinflammation—irritation orswelling—in the gastrointestinal (gi)tract. the exact cause of crohn's diseaseis unknown. researchers believethat factors such as an autoimmunereaction, genes, and environment mayplay a role in causing crohn's disease. crohn's disease can occur in people ofany age. however, it is more likely todevelop in people between the ages of 20 and 29 who have a family member, mostoften a sibling or parent, withinflammatory bowel disease (ibd) who smoke cigarettes the most common signs andsymptoms of crohn's disease arediarrhea, abdominal cramping andpain, and weight loss. a health care provider diagnosescrohn's disease with the following: medical and family history physical exam lab tests upper gi series computerized tomography (ct)scan intestinal endoscopy which treatment a person needsdepends on the severity of the diseaseand symptoms. good nutrition is important in themanagement of crohn's disease. ahealth care provider may recommendthat a person make dietary changes. people with crohn's disease shouldtalk with their health care providerabout how often they should getscreened for colon cancer.[top]hope through researchthe national institute of diabetes anddigestive and kidney diseases' (niddk's)division of digestive diseases
