pagebackgroundintroductionlyme disease (ld) is a tick-borne zoonosiscaused by the spirochaete bacterium, borrelia burgdorferi. since the disease wasfirst recognised in 1975 it has become the most frequently reported human tick-borneinfection worldwide. it has been reported from every continent (except antarctica)although doubt remains as to whether it occurs in the southern hemisphere in general, andin australia in particular. ecologyld is transmitted to humans by ticks.larval and nymphal stages feed on infected reservoir hosts, acquire the organism and then,after moulting to the next life stage (nymphs and adults respectively), pass on theinfection to humans and other animals. in the northern hemisphere, small placental mammalsare reservoir hosts. the only species of ticks shown to be competent vectors of b.burgdorferito humans belong to the ixodespersulcatus complex, including i.scapularisand i.pacificus in the united states, i.ricinus in westerneurope, and i.persulcatus in eastern europe and asia. no species of thiscomplex exist in australia. clinicalfeaturesthe epithet the great imitatoris now used for ld as it was once for another major spirochaetal disease, syphilis. likesyphilis, ld causes a wide range of (mostly) non-specific symptoms and signs; there are 3clinical stages: stage i: manifestations include fever, fatigue, headaches, myalgia, arthralgia (but not arthritis) and lymphadenopathy, usually within 2-3 weeks of infection. a characteristic skin lesion, erythema migrans (em), appears 3-30 days after the bite of an infected tick, usually at the site of inoculation. the initial lesion is a red maculo-papular lesion greater than 5cm in diameter, rarely painful and expands and may reach more than 50cm in diameter, with central clearing and a well defined, circinate border (bulls-eye). multiple lesions at different stages of evolution may be present. allergic reactions, associated with tick bites, may be confused with early em, but occur within a few hours of the bite and resolve within a few days. in north america, em occurs in 60-80% of serologically confirmed cases of ld. stage ii: symptoms are non-specific and occur weeks or months after the tick bite. a causative association with ld is often uncertain. the lesions resemble those of secondary syphilis: carditis, chronic meningitis, mononeuritis (eg bell's palsy) and conjunctivitis. arthralgia and myalgia are often prominent. stage iii: symptoms occur months or years after exposure. the most typical feature, north american, is an erosive arthritis of large joints, particularly the knees. a chronic skin manifestation, acrodermatitis chronica atrophicans (aca) occurs, mainly in european patients. recently, four genospecies of b.burgdorferihave been described; b. burgdorferi sensu stricto, b. garinii, b. afzeliiand b. japonica. they are associated with different patterns of disease, any ofwhich can mimic other diseases. with the possible exceptions of typical em and acaassociated with appropriate exposure, clinical features alone are insufficient fordiagnosis of ld and laboratory tests are required for confirmation. diagnosisculture/pcrisolation of the causative organism from apunch biopsy taken at the edge of the em lesion is successful in up to 80% of cases but itmay be up to 8 weeks before spirochaetes can be detected. polymerase chain reaction (pcr)has the advantage of greater sensitivity and speed; a result is available within 24 hours.isolation and/or pcr should be attempted upon presentation of a patient with an em lesion.serologylaboratory diagnosis of late ld (stage ii iii) is less reliable and depends on serological tests including the indirectfluorescence antibody test (ifat), enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (elisa) and westernimmunoblot (wb). false positive results occur due to cross reactions with other bacteria,especially other spirochaetes, viruses and in unrelated syndromes such as autoimmunediseases. ifat and elisa are used as screening tests but there has been littlestandardisation of methods. any borderline or positive results shouldbe confirmed by wb which can detect protein bands specific for b. burgdorferi. however,nonspecific bands occur, particularly with the highly cross reactive 41kda (flagellin)protein. at the sixth international congress on lyme borreliosis a standardisedinterpretation of wb results was accepted: an igg immunoblot is considered positive if 5of the following 10 bands are present: 18, 21, 28, 30, 39, 41, 45, 58, 66 and 93kda.patients with late stage ld will show 10 or more bands on a wb. treatmentthe antibiotic therapy of early ldgenerally results in complete recovery. a 2 week course of oral doxycycline or amoxycillinfor stage i and a third generation cephalosporin for stage ii are the most commonly usedregimens. treatment of late stage ld is less successful and a chronic or relapsing courseis common. a third generation cephalosporin for 3 weeks is recommended. preventionthe prevention of ld is mainly throughavoidance of tick infested areas and of tick bites by the use of repellents (particularly thosecontaining deet), wearing of light coloured clothing so that ticks are more easily seenand prompt removal of attached ticks. transmission of spirochaetes generally does notoccur until after 24 hours attachment of the tick. antibiotic prophylaxis is notrecommended. trials of ld vaccines are in progress with varying degrees of success. lyme disease in australiahistory - australiathe first australian cases of a syndromeconsistent with lyme disease were reported from the hunter valley region of new southwales in 1982. serology was initially negative on one of the 6 patients, but laterreported as positive in low titre. cases of em with febrile illness were reported in 1986from the south and central coasts of new south wales. all had negative serology. inqueensland, from 1986 to 1989, the state health laboratories tested 1,247 patients for b.burgdorferiantibody using an ifat and reported 186 (15%) positive (titre 64) titres. in none of thesecases was confirmatory serology (wb) undertaken. in 1988 at westmead hospital, amultidisciplinary investigation of putative ld in coastal new south wales began,encompassing clinical, serological, vector and reservoir host studies. clinical investigations - australiaover the past 6 years, due principally tolocal publicity, there has been an increase in serological testing for ld. this is ofteninitiated by patients, who believe that ld may be an explanation for an undiagnosed healthproblem. thus, most patients seen by infectious diseases specialists are self selected andreferred for assessment on the basis of tick exposure and reported positive screeningserology. patients frequently have long-standingsymptoms for which no other diagnosis has been established including myalgia, arthralgiawithout objective evidence of joint disease, neurological symptoms such as frequentheadaches, inability to concentrate and impairment of memory, and syndromes resemblingchronic fatigue syndrome. the late ld dermatological manifestation, aca, has not beenreported in australia. a few cases of em have been reported fromsouth-eastern australia. however, diagnosis can be confounded by a spectacularerythematous hypersensitivity reaction to the bite of i. holocyclus, the mostcommon tick biting humans in new south wales. of eight skin biopsies submitted to westmeadhospital for spirochaete isolation, one, from a patient returning from a ld endemic areain europe, was culture positive for b.burgdorferi. there has been no isolation fromlocal patients.serological investigations -australiano significant difference was found inseroprevalence rates for b.burgdorferi infection in humans between high (ruralresidents) and low (urban residents) tick exposure groups, using an igg elisa. the overallseropositive rate was 2.2% (9/400). the seroprevalence in new south wales is comparablewith that in non-ld areas, where 1-3% of human sera are seropositive due to cross reactingantibodies and contrasts with reports from known endemic areas, outside australia, whererural populations have considerably higher seropositive rates. a serosurvey of dogs in newsouth wales showed a similar result with 2.5% (6/239) seropositive and another frombrisbane also showed no evidence of b.burgdorferi infection. these suggest thatsoutheastern australia is a non-endemic area. from 1988 to 1994 at westmead hospital, 78(1.8%) of 4,372 from local patients with suspected ld were positive for igg by elisa andifat. all 78 were tested by wb, using north american and european strains of borrelia;46 sera showed one or more bands. none, including those with putative late stage disease,showed more than 4 specific bands and thus were all negative by international criteria.twenty-four patients with various bacterial, viral or autoimmune syndromes unrelated to ldwere tested in parallel and 11/24 showed one or 2 indicative bands. thus a high degree ofcross reactivity was demonstrated with non-ld patients. recently, there have been reports fromeastern australia of ld-like illness associated with wb serology yielding bands at 31kda(ospa) and the highly-cross reactive 41kda band. none of these results conforms withinternationally accepted criteria for a positive wb. concomitant with this are results ofwb analysis of sera from patients with syndromes unrelated to ld, 30% of which reactedwith a 41kda band and 10% with the ospa band. the sensitivity of serological testing forld sometimes depends on the strain of borrelia used and could confoundinterpretation of results in australia, where no local spirochaete has been isolated foruse as a reference antigen. vector and reservoir host investigations -australiato detect a possible causative agent, tickswere collected from areas associated with putative infections and examined forspirochaetes by dark field microscopy, culture of gut contents, and direct testing ofticks with pcr for the borrelia-specific flagellin gene. in total, over 12,000 ticks were testedincluding 1,000 by pcr. spirochaete-like objects (slos), were observed in 92 culturesfrom bloodfed ticks but were not typical of borrelia spp. they were found onlyfound in cultures with bacterial contaminants, presumably from the bloodmeal. electronmicrographs were similar to those of slos recovered from contaminated cultures from ticksin missouri, usa and were composed of aggregations of bacterial flagella, thought tooriginate from the contaminants. molecular characterisation indicated that the slos sharedsome antigens with b.burgdorferi, but were not genetically related. similar objectsfound in cultures from dissected bloodfed ticks taken from animals on the mid-north coastof nsw were purported to be related to b.burgdorferi and the probable cause of ldin australia. a small number (17) of native vertebrateanimals were sampled by ear punch biopsy for culture and pcr investigation but there wasno evidence of borreliae. it is possible that the pcr primers usedwere unable to identify australian spirochaetes. however, the tick gut contents were alsonegative by culturing and dark field microscopy. conclusions - australiathere are some major differences betweenaustralia and the endemic areas of the northern hemisphere with respect to the naturalhistory of ld: no ticks of the i. persulcatuscomplex, the principal vectors to humans in the northern hemisphere, occur in australia.in eastern australia, the logical candidate vector would be i.holocycluswhich has a wide host range and is the most common tick biting humans. it was unable totransmit a north american strain of b.burgdorferi but an association with a so farundiscovered australian spirochaete can not be excluded. none of the mammal species identified asreservoir hosts in the northern hemisphere are present in australia. there are reports ofspirochaetes in australian native animals, and a local mammal could be a reservoir hostfor an indigenous spirochaete that occasionally infects humans through a tick vector andproduces a clinical syndrome similar to ld; however, no spirochaete was detected in the12,000 ticks or animals processed. summarythe diagnosis of ld outside known endemicareas cannot be based solely on serological tests especially if they fail to conform withinternationally accepted criteria, because of the high incidence of false positiveresults. a clinical diagnosis in a non-endemicdisease area (especially of stage ii or iii disease), is difficult to support withoutisolation of the causative agent from the patient, from other patients with similarillness or from a known vector in the region. the existence of ld in australia willremain controversial until an organism is isolated from a local patient and fullycharacterised, or until a tick-borne organism can be shown to be responsible for the humaninfection. if it exists it shares few of the epidemiological or clinical characteristicsof us or european patterns of ld. further readingbaldock, f.c., yamane, i., and gardner, i.
