todar, phdborrelia burgdorferi,the spirochete that causes lyme disease. fa stain (cdc)introductionlyme disease was first recognized in the united states in1975by dr. allen steere, following a mysterious outbreak of juvenilerheumatoidarthritis near the community of lyme, connecticut. the rural locationofthe lyme outbreak and the onset of illness during summer and early fallsuggested that the transmission of the disease was by an arthropodvector.in 1982, the etiologic agent of lyme disease was discovered by willyburgdorfer, who isolated spirochetes belonging to the genus borreliafrom the mid-guts of ixodes ticks. he showed that thesespirochetesreacted with immune serum from patients that had been diagnosed withlymedisease. subsequently, the etiologic agent was given the name borreliaburgdorferi. since then, reports of lyme disease have increaseddramatically tothepoint that the disease has become an important public health problem insome areas of the united states. today, lyme disease is the mostprevalenttick-borne illness in the united states.incidenceof lyme disease in the united states, 1991-2006. lyme disease is themostprevalenttick-borne illness in the united states. in 2006, there were 19,931 newcasesreported. between 1996 and 2001 the average number was about 17,000 newcases per year but increased to near or above 20,000 new cases per yearin 2002, probably due to increased surveillance and reporting. cdc.biology of spirochetesborrelia burgdorferi, like the human pathogen treponemapallidum,is a spirochete. spirochetes are a group ofphylogenetically-distinctbacteria that have a unique mode of motility by means of axialfilaments(endoflagella). spirochetes are widespread in viscous environments andthey are found in the intestinal tracts of animals and the oral cavityof humans. the spirochetes have a unique cell surface which accompaniestheir unique type of motility. the endoflagella are contained withintheperiplasmic space between a semi rigid peptidoglycan helix and amulti-layer,flexible outer membrane sheath. when the filaments rotate within thisspace,the spirochetes move in cork-screw fashion. this type of movement isthought tobe an adaptation to viscous environments, such as aquatic sediments,biofilms,mucosal tissues and the intestinal tracts of animals. for pathogens,thisallows the spirochetes to hide their flagella, which are normallyantigenic,from the host immune defenses.spirochetes are usually much longer than they are wide, and oftentheirwidth is below the resolving power of the light microscope. forexample,borreliamay have a length of 20-30um but a width of only 0.2-0.3um. hence, mostspirochetescannot be viewed using conventional light microscopy. dark-fieldmicroscopymust be used to view spirochetes. dark field microscopy utilizes aspecialcondenser which directs light toward an object at a angle, rather thanfrom the bottom. as a result, particles or cells are seen as lightobjectsagainst a dark background.b. burgdorferi darkfieldillumination. american society for microbiology.the spirochetes are not classified as either gram-positive orgram-negative.when borrelia burgdorferi is gram-stained, the cells stain aweakgram-negative by default, as safranin is the last dye used. borrelia,like most spirochetes, does have an outer membrane that contains anlps-likesubstance, an inner membrane, and a periplasmic space which contains alayer of peptidoglycan. therefore, it has a gram-negative bacterialtypecell wall, despite its staining characteristics.cultivationunlike treponema pallidum, borrelia burgdorferi canbecultivated in vitro. however, the bacterium is fastidious and requiresa very complex growth medium. the medium used to grow borreliaburgdorferiis called barbour-stoenner-kelly (bsk) medium. it contains overthirteeningredients in a rabbit serum base. borrelia burgdorferi has anoptimal temperature for growth of 32oc, in a microaerobicenvironment.even under optimal conditions, the generation time is slow, about 12-24hours.borreliae from ticks and from the blood, skin, andcerebrospinal fluidof lyme disease patients have been successfully cultivated in bskmedium.bsk solidified with 1.3% agarose allows the production of colonies fromsingle organisms.strains of borreliathe borreliae causing lyme disease are divided intoseveral"genospecies", three of which have been firmly established andarewell accepted:i. borrelia burgdorferi sensu strictoii. borrelia gariniiiii. borrelia afzeliithe term used to collectively describe all three genospecies is borreliaburgdorferi sensu lato. the differences in genospecies arerevealedby restriction fragment length polymorphism, (rflp), multi-locus enzymeelectrophoresis (mlee) and ssrna sequences. all u.s. isolates fall intogenospecies i. examples of all three genospecies have been found ineuropeand asia, although ii and iii predominate there.outer surface proteinsthe outer membrane of borrelia burgdorferi is composed ofvariousunique outer surface proteins (osp) that have been characterized (osp athrough ospf). they are presumed to play a role in virulence. osp a andosp b are by far the most abundant outer surface proteins. the genesencodingthese proteins are transcribed from a common promoter and are locatedon a 49 kb linear plasmid. the chromosome of borrelia burgdorferiis also linear and is almost 1100 kb in size.pathogenicityborrelia burgdorferi invades the blood and tissues of variousinfected mammals and birds. the natural reservoir for borreliaburgdorferiis thought to be the white-footed mouse. ticks transfer the spirochetesto the white-tailed deer, humans, and other warm-blooded animals aftera blood meal on an infected animal. in humans, dogs, and many otheranimals,infection with borrelia burgdorferi results in the pathology oflyme disease. chapter continued next page kenneth todar, ph.d. all rights
