responsible for up to two-thirds of the cases. diabetes happens when your blood sugar is too high, causing damage to many organs in your body, including the kidneys and heart, as well as blood vessels, nerves and eyes. high blood pressure, or hypertension, occurs when the pressure of your blood against the walls of your blood vessels increases. if uncontrolled, or poorly controlled, high blood pressure can be a leading cause of heart attacks, strokes and chronic kidney disease. also, chronic kidney disease can cause high blood pressure.other conditions that affect the kidneys are: glomerulonephritis, a group of diseases that cause inflammation and damage to the kidneys filtering units. these disorders are the third most common type of kidney disease. inherited diseases, such as polycystic kidney disease, which causes large cysts to form in the kidneys and damage the surrounding tissue. malformations that occur as a baby develops in its mothers womb. for example, a narrowing may occur that prevents normal outflow of urine and causes urine to flow back up to the kidney. this causes infections and may damage the kidneys. lupus and other diseases that affect the bodys immune system. obstructions caused by problems like kidney stones, tumors or an enlarged prostate gland in men. repeated urinary infections.what are the symptoms of ckd?most people may not have any severe symptoms until their kidney disease is advanced. however, you may notice that you: feel more tired and have less energy have trouble concentrating have a poor appetite have trouble sleeping have
