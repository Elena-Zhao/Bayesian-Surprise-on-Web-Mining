parkinson's disease?what research is being done?where can i get more information?glossaryintroduction parkinson's disease (pd) is a degenerative disorder of the central nervous system.it was first described in 1817 by james parkinson, a british physician who published a paper on what he called "the shaking palsy." in this paper, he described the major signs and symptoms of the disease that would later bear his name. research suggests at least 500,000 people in the united states currently have pd, although some estimates are much higher. society pays an enormous price for pd. the total cost to the nation is estimated to exceed $6 billion annually.the risk of pd increases with age, so it is expected that the financial and public health impact of this disease will increase as the population gets older. what is parkinson's disease? parkinson's disease belongs to a group of conditions called movement disorders. the four main symptoms are tremor, or trembling in hands, arms, legs, jaw, or head; rigidity, or stiffness of the limbs and trunk; bradykinesia, or slowness of movement; and postural instability, or impaired balance. these symptoms usually begin gradually and worsen with time.as they become more pronounced, patients may have difficulty walking, talking, or completing other simple tasks.not everyone with one or more of these symptoms has pd, as the symptoms appear in other diseases as well. pd is both chronic, meaning it persists over a long period of time, and progressive, meaning its symptoms grow worse over time. unlike measles, you cannot catch parkinsons disease from someone else. although some cases of pd are hereditary and can be traced to specific genetic mutations, most cases are sporadicthat is, the disease does not typically run in families.pd likely results from a combination of genetic susceptibility and exposure to one or more environmental factors that trigger the disease. pd is the most common form of parkinsonism, the name for a group of disorders with similar features and symptoms.pd is also called idiopathic pd. the term idiopathic means a disorder for which no cause has been found. while most forms of parkinsonism are idiopathic, there are some cases where the cause is known or suspected or where the symptoms result from another disorder. what causes the disease? parkinson's disease occurs when nerve cells, or neurons, in the brain die or become impaired. the main area affected is an area near the base of the brain called the substantia nigra.normally, the neurons in this area produce an important brain chemical known as dopamine. dopamine is a chemical messenger responsible for transmitting signals between the substantia nigra and the next "relay station" of the brain, the corpus striatum, to produce smooth, purposeful movement. loss of dopamine results in abnormal nerve firing patterns within the brain that cause impaired movement. studies have shown that most people with parkinson's have lost 60 to 80 percent or more of the dopamine-producing cells in the substantia nigra by the time symptoms appear, and that people with pd also have loss of the nerve endings that produce the neurotransmitter norepinephrine. norepinephrine, which is closely related to dopamine, is the main chemical messenger of the sympathetic nervous system, the part of the nervous system that controls many automatic functions of the body, such as pulse and blood pressure. the loss of norepinephrine might explain several of the non-motor features seen in pd, including fatigue and abnormalities of blood pressure regulation. many brain cells of people with pd contain lewy bodiesdeposits of the protein alpha-synuclein.researchers do not yet know why lewy bodies form or what role they play in the disease.some research suggests that the cells protein disposal system may fail in people with pd, causing proteins to build up to harmful levels and trigger cell death. additional studies have found evidence that clumps of protein that develop inside brain cells of people with pd may contribute to the death of neurons. however, the precise role of the protein deposits remains unknown. some researchers even speculate that this protein buildup is part of an unsuccessful attempt to protect the cell. scientists have identified several genetic mutations associated with pd, and many more genes have been tentatively linked to the disorder.studying the genes responsible for inherited cases of pd can help researchers understand both inherited and sporadic cases. the same genes and proteins that are altered in inherited cases may also be altered in sporadic cases by environmental toxins or other factors. researchers also hope that discovering genes will help identify new ways of treating pd. in addition to genetics, environmental exposures may increase a person's risk of developing the disease. even in familial cases, exposure to toxins or other environmental factors may influence when symptoms of the disease appear or how the disease progresses. there are a number of toxins that can cause parkinsonian symptoms in humans.other, still-unidentified environmental factors also may cause pd in genetically susceptible individuals.inflammation or overstimulation of cells (because of toxins or other factors) may play a role in the disease. several lines of research suggest that mitochondria may play a role in the development of pd. mitochondria are the energy-producing components of the cell and abnormalities in the mitochondria are major sources of free radicalsmolecules that damage membranes, proteins, dna, and other parts of the cell. this damage is often referred to as oxidative stress. oxidative stress-related changes, including free radical damage to dna, proteins, and fats, have been detected in brains of pd patients. while mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, inflammation, and many other cellular processes may contribute to pd, the actual initial cause of the dopamine cell death is still undetermined. what genes are linked to parkinson's disease? several genes have now been definitively linked to pd. the first to be identified was alpha-synuclein. in the 1990s, researchers at nih and other institutions studied the genetic profiles of a large italian family and three greek families with familial pd and found that their disease was related to a mutation in this gene. they found a second alpha-synuclein mutation in a german family with pd. these findings prompted studies of the role of alpha-synuclein in pd, which led to the discovery that lewy bodies (abnormal masses of protein that develop inside nerve cells) seen in sporadic pd contain alpha-synuclein protein. this discovery revealed a potential link between hereditary and sporadic forms of the disease. in 2003, researchers studying inherited pd discovered that the disease in one large family was caused by a triplication of the normal alpha-synuclein gene on one copy of chromosome 4.this triplication caused people in the affected family to produce too much of the normal alpha-synuclein.this study showed that an excess of the normal form of the protein could result in pd, just as the abnormal form does. other genes linked to pd include parkin, dj-1, pink1, and lrrk2. dj-1 and pink1 cause rare, early-onset forms of pd.the parkin gene is translated into a protein that normally helps cells break down and recycle proteins.dj-1 normally helps regulate gene activity and protect cells from oxidative stress.pink1 codes for a protein active in mitochondria. mutations in this gene appear to increase susceptibility to cellular stress. mutations in lrrk2 were originally identified in several english and basque families as a cause of a late-onset pd.subsequent studies have identified mutations this gene in other families with pd as well as in a small percentage of people with apparently sporadic pd. another interesting association is with the gba gene, which makes the enzyme glucocerebrosidase.mutations in this gene cause gaucher disease (in which fatty acids, oils, waxes, and steroids accumulate in the brain), but different changes in this gene are associated with an increased risk for parkinsons disease as well.studies trying to see what this association can tell us about parkinson risk in general are ongoing. who gets parkinson's disease? about 50,000 americans are diagnosed with pd each year, but getting an accurate count of the number of cases is difficult because many people in the early stages of the disease may assume their symptoms are the result of normal aging and do not seek medical attention. also, diagnosis is sometimes difficult and uncertain because other conditions may produce symptoms of pd and there is no definitive test for the disease. people with pd may sometimes be told by their doctors that they have other disorders, and people with pd-like diseases may be incorrectly diagnosed as having pd. pd affects about 50 percent more men than women, and the reasons for this discrepancy are unclear.while it occurs in people throughout the world, a number of studies have found a higher incidence in developed countries.other studies have found an increased risk in people who live in rural areas and in those who work in certain professions, although apparent risks are not fully characterized. one clear risk factor for pd is age.the average age of onset is 60 years, and the incidence rises significantly with increasing age.however, about 5 to 10 percent of people with pd have "early-onset" disease that begins before the age of 50. some early onset cases are linked to specific gene mutations such as parkin. people with one or more close relatives who have pd have an increased risk of developing the disease themselves, but the total risk is still about 2 to 5 percent unless the family has a known gene mutation for the disease.an estimated 15 to 25 percent of people with pd have a known relative with the disease. in very rare cases, parkinsonian symptoms may appear in people before the age of 20.this condition is called juvenile parkinsonism.it often begins with dystonia and bradykinesia, and the symptoms often improve with levodopa medication. what are the symptoms of the disease? early symptoms of pd may be subtle and occur gradually. affected people may feel mild tremors or have difficulty getting out of a chair.activities may take longer to complete than in the past and individuals may note some stiffness in addition to slowness. they may notice that they speak too softly or that their handwriting is slow and looks cramped or small.this very early period may last a long time before the more classical and obvious motor symptomsshaking (tremor), stiffness (rigidity), slowness of movement (bradykinesia) and unsteadiness (postural instability)appear. friends or family members may be the first to notice changes in someone with early pd. they may see that the person's face lacks expression and animation (known as "masked face") or that the person moves more slowly. as the disease progresses, the symptoms of parkinson's disease may begin to interfere with daily activities. affected individuals may not be able to hold utensils steady or they may find that the shaking makes reading a newspaper difficult. tremor is usually the symptom that causes people to seek medical help. people with pd often develop a so-called parkinsonian gait that includes a tendency to lean forward, small quick steps as if hurrying (called festination), and reduced swinging of the arms. they also may have trouble initiating movement (start hesitation), and they may stop suddenly as they walk (freezing). pd does not affect everyone the same way, and the rate of progression and the particular symptoms may differ among individuals. pd symptoms typically begin on one side of the body.however, the disease eventually affects both sides.even after the disease involves both sides of the body, the symptoms are often less severe on one side than on the other.the four primary symptoms of pd are: tremor. the tremor associated with pd has a characteristic appearance. typically, the tremor takes the form of a rhythmic back-and-forth motion at a rate of 4-6 beats per second. it may involve the thumb and forefinger and appear as a "pill rolling" tremor.tremor often begins in a hand, although sometimes a foot or the jaw is affected first. it is most obvious when the hand is at rest or when a person is under stress. tremor usually disappears during sleep or improves with intentional movement. rigidity. rigidity, or a resistance to movement, affects most people with pd.the muscles remain constantly tensed and contracted so that the person aches or feels stiff. the rigidity becomes obvious when another person tries to move the individual's arm, which will move only in ratchet-like or short, jerky movements known as "cogwheel" rigidity. bradykinesia. bradykinesia, or the slowing down of spontaneous and automatic movement, is particularly frustrating because it may make simple tasks somewhat difficult.the person cannot rapidly perform routine movements. activities once performed quickly and easily such as washing or dressing may take much longer. postural instability. postural instability, or impaired balance, causes affected individuals to fall easily. a number of other symptoms may accompany pd, and some can be treated with medication or physical therapy. depression. this is a common problem and may appear early in the course of the disease, even before other symptoms are noticed.some people lose their motivation and become dependent on family members. fortunately, depression typically can be treated successfully with antidepressant medications. emotional changes. some people with pd become fearful and insecure, while others may become irritable or uncharacteristically pessimistic. difficulty with swallowing and chewing. muscles used in swallowing may work less efficiently in later stages of the disease. in these cases, food and saliva may collect in the mouth and back of the throat, which can result in choking or drooling. these problems also may make it difficult to get adequate nutrition.speech-language therapists, occupational therapists (who help people learn new ways to perform activities of daily living), and dieticians can often help with these problems. speech changes. about half of all individuals with pd have speech difficulties that may be characterized as speaking too softly or in a monotone. some may hesitate before speaking, slur, or speak too fast. a speech therapist may be able to help these individuals reduce some of these problems. urinary problems or constipation. in some people with pd, bladder and bowel problems can occur due to the improper functioning of the autonomic nervous system, which is responsible for regulating smooth muscle activity. medications can effectively treat some of these symptoms. skin problems. in pd, the skin on the face may become oily, particularly on the forehead and at the sides of the nose. the scalp may become oily too, resulting in dandruff. in other cases, the skin can become very dry. standard treatments for skin problems can help. sleep problems. sleep problems are common in pd and include difficulty staying asleep at night, restless sleep, nightmares and emotional dreams, and drowsiness or sudden sleep onset during the day.another common problem is rem behavior disorder, or rbd, in which people act out their dreams, potentially resulting in injury to themselves or their bed partners.the medications used to treat pd may contribute to some of these sleep issues.many of these problems respond to specific therapies. dementia or other cognitive problems. some people with pd may develop memory problems and slow thinking.cognitive problems become more severe in late stages of pd, and a diagnosis of parkinsons disease dementia (pdd) may be given. memory, social judgment, language, reasoning, or other mental skills may be affected.there is currently no way to halt pd dementia, but some drugs like rivastigmine, donepezil, or memantine can help. orthostatic hypotension. orthostatic hypotension is a sudden drop in blood pressure when a person stands up from a lying-down or seated position.this may cause dizziness, lightheadedness, and, in extreme cases, loss of balance or fainting.studies have suggested that, in pd, this problem results from a loss of nerve endings in the sympathetic nervous system that controls heart rate, blood pressure, and other automatic functions in the body.the medications used to treat pd also may contribute to this symptom.there are both non-pharmacologic (lifestyle) measures and medications that can be used to address this. muscle cramps and dystonia.the rigidity and lack of normal movement associated with pd often causes muscle cramps, especially in the legs and toes. massage, stretching, and applying heat may help with these cramps.pd also can be associated with dystoniasustained muscle contractions that cause forced or twisted positions.dystonia in pd is often caused by fluctuations in the body's level of dopamine.it can often be relieved or reduced by adjusting medications. pain. many people with pd develop aching muscles and joints because of the rigidity and abnormal postures often associated with the disease.treatment with levodopa and other dopaminergic drugs often alleviates these pains to some extent.certain exercises also may help. fatigue and loss of energy.many people with pd often have fatigue, especially late in the day.fatigue may be associated with depression or sleep disorders, but it also may result from muscle stress or from overdoing activity when the person feels well.fatigue also may result from akinesia trouble initiating or carrying out movement.exercise, good sleep habits, staying mentally active, and not forcing too many activities in a short time may help to alleviate fatigue. sexual dysfunction.men with pd may have erectile dysfunction because of its effects on nerve signals from the brain.pd-related depression or use of certain medications also may cause decreased sex drive and other problems.people should discuss these issues with their physician as they may be treatable. what other diseases resemble parkinson's? a number of disorders can cause symptoms similar to those of pd.people with symptoms that resemble pd but that result from other causes are considered to have parkinsonism.some of these disorders include:. multiple system atrophy.multiple system atrophy (msa) refers to a set of slowly progressive disorders that affect the central and autonomic nervous systems. msa is one of a group of neurodegenerative disorders (including parkinsons disease and dementia with lewy bodies) in which the protein alpha-synuclein forms harmful filament-like aggregates in certain neurons and supporting cells in the brain.msa may have symptoms that resemble pd.it also may take a form that primarily produces poor coordination and slurred speech, or it may have a mixture of these symptoms. other symptoms may include swallowing difficulties, male impotence, constipation, and urinary difficulties.the disorder previously called shy-drager syndrome refers to msa with prominent orthostatic hypotensiona fall in blood pressure every time the person stands up.msa with parkinsonian symptoms is sometimes referred to as msa-p (or striatonigral degeneration), while msa with poor coordination and slurred speech is sometimes called msa-c (or olivopontocerebellar atrophy). dementia with lewy bodies. dementia with lewy bodies is a neurodegenerative disorder associated with abnormal protein deposits (lewy bodies) found in certain areas of the brain.symptoms may include traditional parkinsonian symptoms such as bradykinesia, rigidity, tremor, and shuffling walk, to symptoms similar to those of alzheimer's disease (memory loss, poor judgment, and confusion). these symptoms may fluctuate, or wax and wane dramatically. visual hallucinations may be one of the first symptoms, and individuals may suffer from other psychiatric disturbances such as delusions and depression.cognitive problems also occur early in the course of the disease. levodopa and other antiparkinsonian medications can help with the motor symptoms of dementia with lewy bodies, but they may make hallucinations and delusions worse. progressive supranuclear palsy. progressive supranuclear palsy (psp) is a rare, progressive brain disorder that causes problems with control of gait and balance.people often tend to fall early in the course of psp.one of the characteristic features of the disease is an inability to move the eyes properly. some people describe this effect as a blurring. people with psp often show alterations of mood and behavior, including depression and apathy as well as mild dementia.the symptoms of psp are caused by a gradual deterioration of brain cells in the brain stem. it is often misdiagnosed because some of its symptoms are very much like those of pd, alzheimer's disease, and other brain disorders. psp symptoms usually do not respond to medication. corticobasal degeneration. corticobasal degeneration results from atrophy of multiple areas of the brain, including the cerebral cortex and the basal ganglia. initial symptoms may first appear on one side of the body, but eventually affect both sides. symptoms are similar to some of the features found in pd, including rigidity, impaired balance, and problems with coordination. often there is dystonia affecting one side of the body.other symptoms may include cognitive and visual-spatial impairments, apraxia (loss of the ability to make familiar, purposeful movements), hesitant and halting speech, myoclonus (muscular jerks), and dysphagia (difficulty swallowing).unlike pd, corticobasal degeneration usually does not respond to medication. several diseases, including msa, corticobasal degeneration, and progressive supranuclear palsy, are sometimes referred to as "parkinson's-plus" diseases because they have the symptoms of pd plus additional features. parkinsonism resulting from neurological disorders arteriosclerotic parkinsonism. sometimes known as pseudoparkinsonism, vascular parkinsonism, or atherosclerotic parkinsonism, arteriosclerotic parkinsonism involves damage to the brain due to multiple strokes.tremor is rare in this type of parkinsonism, while dementiathe loss of mental skills and abilitiesand difficulties with gait are common. antiparkinsonian drugs are of little help to people with this form of parkinsonism. post-traumatic parkinsonism.also known as post-traumatic encephalopathy or "punch-drunk syndrome," parkinsonian symptoms can sometimes develop after a severe head injury or frequent head trauma that results from boxing or other activities.this type of trauma also can cause a form of dementia called chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or dementia pugilistica. essential tremor, sometimes called benign essential tremor or familial tremor, is a common condition that tends to run in families and progresses slowly over time.the tremor is usually equal in both hands and increases when the hands are moving.it may involve the head but usually spares the legs. essential tremor is not the same as parkinsons disease and does not usually lead to it, although in some cases the two conditions may overlap in one person.people with essential tremor have no other parkinsonian features. essential tremor does not respond to levodopa or most other pd drugs, but it can be treated with other medications. normal pressure hydrocephalus.normal pressure hydrocephalus (nph) is an abnormal increase of cerebrospinal fluid (csf) in the brain's ventricles, or cavities. this causes the ventricles to enlarge, putting pressure on the brain.symptoms include problems with walking, impaired bladder control leading to urinary frequency or incontinence, and progressive mental impairment and dementia. the person also may have a general slowing of movements or may complain that his or her feet feel "stuck." these symptoms may sometimes be mistaken for pd.brain scans, intracranial pressure monitoring, and other tests can help to distinguish nph from pd and other disorders.nph can sometimes be treated by surgically implanting a csf shunt that drains excess cerebrospinal fluid into the abdomen, where it is absorbed. parkinsonism accompanying other conditions. parkinsonian symptoms may also appear in individuals with other, clearly distinct neurological disorders such as wilson's disease, huntington's disease, alzheimer's disease, spinocerebellar ataxias, and creutzfeldt-jakob disease.each of these disorders has specific features that help to distinguish them from pd. environmental causes postencephalitic parkinsonism. just after the first world war, the viral disease encephalitis lethargica attacked almost 5 million people throughout the world, and then suddenly disappeared in the 1920s. known as sleeping sickness in the united states, this disease killed one-third of its victims and led to post-encephalitic parkinsonism in many others.this resulted in a movement disorder that appeared sometimes years after the initial illness. (in 1973, neurologist oliver sacks published awakenings, an account of his work in the late 1960s with surviving post-encephalitic patients in a new york hospital. using the then-experimental drug levodopa, dr. sacks was able to temporarily "awaken" these individuals from their statue-like state). in rare cases, other viral infections, including western equine encephalomyelitis, eastern equine encephalomyelitis, and japanese b encephalitis, have caused parkinsonian symptoms. drug-induced parkinsonism. a reversible form of parkinsonism sometimes results from use of certain drugs, such as chlorpromazine and haloperidol, which are typically prescribed for patients with psychiatric disorders. some drugs used for stomach disorders (metoclopramide), high blood pressure (reserpine), and others such as valproate can cause tremor. stopping the medication or lowering the dosage of these medications usually causes the symptoms to go away. toxin-induced parkinsonism. some toxins can cause parkinsonism by various mechanisms. the chemical mptp also causes a permanent form of parkinsonism that closely resembles pd. investigators discovered this reaction in the 1980s when heroin addicts in california who had taken an illicit street drug contaminated with mptp began to develop severe parkinsonism. this discovery, which showed that a toxic substance could damage the brain and produce parkinsonian symptoms, caused a dramatic breakthrough in parkinson's research. parkinsonism-dementia complex of guam. this disease occurs among the chamorro populations of guam and the mariana islands and may be accompanied by a motor neuron disease resembling amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (lou gehrig's disease). the course of the disease is rapid, with death typically occurring within 5 years. how is parkinson's disease diagnosed? there are currently no blood or laboratory tests that diagnose sporadic pd.therefore the diagnosis is based on medical history and a neurological examination.in some cases pd can be difficult to diagnose accurately early on in the course of the disease.early signs and symptoms of pd may sometimes be dismissed as the effects of normal aging.doctors may sometimes request brain scans or laboratory tests in order to rule out other disorders. however, ct and mri brain scans of people with pd usually appear normal.since many other diseases have similar features but require different treatments, making a precise diagnosis is important so that people can receive the proper treatment. what is the prognosis? pd is not a fatal disease, and the average life expectancy of a person with pd is generally the same as for people who do not have the disease.however, in the late stages, pd may be associated with complications such as choking, pneumonia, and falls.fortunately, there are many treatment options available for people with pd. pd is a slowly progressive disorder.it is not possible to predict what course the disease will take for an individual person.one commonly used scale neurologists use for describing how the symptoms of pd have progressed in a patient is the hoehn and yahr scale. hoehn and yahr staging of parkinson's disease stage one symptoms on one side of the body only. stage two symptoms on both sides of the body. no impairment of balance. stage three balance impairment. mild to moderate disease. physically independent. stage four severe disability, but still able to walk or stand unassisted. stage five wheelchair-bound or bedridden unless assisted. another commonly used scale is the movement disorders society-unified parkinson's disease rating scale (mds-updrs). this four-part scale measures motor movement in pd: non-motor experiences of daily living, motor experiences of daily living, motor examination, and motor complications. both the hoehn and yahr scale and the mds-updrs are used to describe how individuals are faring and help to assess how much treatments are helping them. with medications, most people with pd can live productive lives for many years after diagnosis. how is the disease treated? at present, there is no cure for pd, but medications or surgery can often provide improvement in the motor symptoms. drug treatments medications for pd fall into three categories. the first category includes drugs that increase the level of dopamine in the brain. the most common drugs for pd are dopamine precursors substances such as levodopa that cross the blood-brain barrier and are then changed into dopamine. other drugs mimic dopamine or prevent or slow its breakdown. the second category of pd drugs affects other neurotransmitters in the body in order to ease some of the symptoms of the disease. for example, anticholinergic drugs interfere with production or uptake of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. these can be effective in reducing tremors. the third category of drugs prescribed for pd includes medications that help control the non-motor symptoms of the disease, that is, the symptoms that don't affect movement. for example, people with pd-related depression may be prescribed antidepressants. levodopa.the cornerstone of therapy for pd is the drug levodopa (also called l-dopa). nerve cells can use levodopa to make dopamine and replenish the brain's reduced supply. people cannot simply take dopamine pills because dopamine does not easily pass through the blood-brain barrier, a lining of cells inside blood vessels that regulates the transport of oxygen, glucose, and other substances into the brain. usually, people are given levodopa combined with another substance called carbidopa. when added to levodopa, carbidopa delays the conversion of levodopa into dopamine until it reaches the brain, preventing or diminishing some of the side effects that can accompany levodopa therapy.levodopa is often very successful at reducing the tremors and other motor symptoms of pd during the early stages of the disease.it allows the majority of people with pd to extend the period of time in which they can lead active, productive lives. although levodopa helps most people with pd, not all symptoms respond equally to the drug. levodopa usually helps most with bradykinesia and rigidity. problems with balance may not be responsive. people often see noticeable improvement in their symptoms after starting levodopa therapy.however, they may need to increase the dose gradually for maximum benefit. proteins can interfere with the absorption of levodopa from the stomach, so it may sometimes be necessary to avoid taking the medication close to a meal. levodopa is often so effective that some people may temporarily forget they have pd during the early stages of the disease. but levodopa is not a cure. although it can reduce the symptoms of pd, it does not replace lost nerve cells and it does not stop the progression of the disease. levodopa can have a variety of side effects. the most common initial side effects include nausea, low blood pressure, and restlessness. the drug also can cause drowsiness or sudden sleep onset, which can make driving and other activities dangerous.long-term use of levodopa sometimes causes hallucinations and psychosis.the nausea and vomiting caused by levodopa are greatly reduced by combining levodopa and carbidopa. dyskinesias, or involuntary movements such twisting and writhing, commonly develop in people who take levodopa over an extended period. these movements may be either mild or severe. the dosage of levodopa is sometimes reduced in order to lessen these drug-induced movements; however, the pd symptoms often reappear with lower dosages. the drug amantadine is sometimes of benefit for dyskinesias.doctors and indiiduals must work together closely to find a tolerable balance between the drug's benefits and side effects. if dyskinesias are severe, surgical treatment may be considered. because dyskinesias tend to occur with long-term use of levodopa, doctors often start younger individuals with pd on other dopamine-increasing drugs and add levodopa later in the course of the disease. other difficulties may be encountered later in the disease course. patients may begin to notice more pronounced symptoms before their first dose of medication in the morning and between doses as the period of effectiveness after each dose may begin to shorten, called the wearing-off effect. people may also experience sudden, unpredictable off periods, where the medications do not seem to be working. one approach to alleviating these side effects is to take levodopa more often and in smaller amounts. people with pd should never stop taking levodopa without their physician's input, because rapidly withdrawing the drug can have potentially serious side effects. in addition to levodopa-carbidopa, there are other available treatments: dopamine agonists.these drugs, which include apomorphine, pramipexole, ropinirole, and rotigotine, mimic the role of dopamine in the brain. they can be given alone or with levodopa. they are somewhat less effective than levodopa in treating pd symptoms.many of the potential side effects are similar to those associated with the use of levodopa, including drowsiness, sudden sleep onset, hallucinations, confusion, dyskinesias, edema (swelling due to excess fluid in body tissues), nightmares, and vomiting.in rare cases, they can cause an uncontrollable desire to gamble, hypersexuality, or compulsive shopping. mao-b inhibitors. these drugs inhibit the enzyme monoamine oxidase b, or mao-b, which breaks down dopamine in the brain.mao-b inhibitors cause dopamine to accumulate in surviving nerve cells and reduce the symptoms of pd.studies supported by the ninds have shown that selegiline (also called deprenyl) can delay the need for levodopa therapy by up to a year or more. when selegiline is given with levodopa, it appears to enhance and prolong the response to levodopa and thus may reduce wearing-off. selegiline is usually well-tolerated, although side effects may include nausea, orthostatic hypotension, or insomnia.it should not be taken with the antidepressant fluoxetine or the sedative meperidine, because combining selegiline with these drugs can be harmful.another mao-b inhibitor, rasagiline, was approved by the fda in may 2006 for use in treating the motor symptoms of pd with our without levodopa. study results announced in 2013 showed people with parkinsons disease who took rasagiline as an add-on treatment to dopamine agonists showed a slower rate of disease worsening and less worsening between baselines than in individuals who took a placebo. comt inhibitors.comt stands for catechol-o-methyltransferase, another enzyme that breaks down dopamine.the drug entacapone and tolcapone prolong the effects of levodopa by preventing the breakdown of dopamine. comt inhibitors can decrease the duration of "off periods of one's dose of levodopa.the most common side effect is diarrhea.the drugs may also cause nausea, sleep disturbances, dizziness, urine discoloration, abdominal pain, low blood pressure, or hallucinations.in a few rare cases, tolcapone has caused severe liver disease, and people taking tolcapone need regular monitoring of their liver function. amantadine. an antiviral drug, amantadine, can help reduce symptoms of pd and levodopa-induced dyskinesia.it is often used alone in the early stages of the disease.it also may be used with an anticholinergic drug or levodopa.after several months, amantadine's effectiveness wears off in up to half of the people taking it. amantadine's side effects may include insomnia, mottled skin, edema, agitation, or hallucinations. researchers are not certain how amantadine works in pd, but it may increase the effects of dopamine. anticholinergics. these drugs, which include trihexyphenidyl, benztropine, and ethopropazine, decrease the activity of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and can be particularly effective for tremor.side effects may include dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention, hallucinations, memory loss, blurred vision, and confusion. when recommending a course of treatment, a doctor will assess how much the symptoms disrupt the persons life and then tailor therapy to the person's particular condition. since no two people will react the same way to a given drug, it may take time and patience to get the dose just right. even then, symptoms may not be completely alleviated. medications to treat the motor symptoms of parkinson's disease category generic brand name drugs that increase brain levels of dopamine levodopa-carbidopa parcopa, sinemet drugs that mimic dopamine (dopamine agonists) apomorphine pramipexole ropinirole rotigotine apokyn mirapex requip neupro drugs that inhibit dopamine breakdown (mao-b inhibitors) rasagiline selegiline (deprenyl) azilect eldepryl, zelapar drugs that inhibit dopamine breakdown (comt inhibitors) entacapone tolcapone comtan tasmar drugs that decrease the action of acetylcholine (anticholinergics) benztropine ethopropazine trihexyphenidyl cogentin parsidol artane drugs with an unknown mechanism of action for pd amantadine symmetrek medications for non-motor symptoms. doctors may prescribe a variety of medications to treat the non-motor symptoms of pd, such as depression and anxiety.for example, depression can be treated with standard antidepressant drugs such as amitriptyline or fluoxetine (however, as stated earlier, fluoxetine should not be combined with mao-b inhibitors).anxiety can sometimes be treated with drugs called benzodiazepines.orthostatic hypotension may be helped by increasing salt intake, reducing antihypertension drugs, or prescribing medications such as fludrocortisone. hallucinations, delusions, and other psychotic symptoms can be caused by the drugs prescribed for pd.reducing pd medications dosages or changing medications may be necessary if hallucinations occur.if such measures are not effective, doctors sometimes prescribe drugs called atypical antipsychotics, which include clozapine and quetiapine.clozapine also may help to control dyskinesias. however, clozapine also can cause a serious blood disorder called agranulocytosis, so people who take it must have their blood monitored frequently. surgery before the discovery of levodopa, surgery was a common option to treating pd.studies in the past few decades have led to great improvements in surgical techniques, and surgery is again considered for people with pd for whom drug therapy is no longer sufficient. pallidotomy and thalamotomy. the earliest types of surgery for pd involved selectively destroying specific parts of the brain that contribute to pd symptoms.surgical techniques have been refined and can be very effective for the motor symptoms of pd.the most common lesion surgery is called pallidotomy. in this procedure, a surgeon selectively destroys a portion of the brain called the globus pallidus.pallidotomy can improve symptoms of tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia, possibly by interrupting the connections between the globus pallidus and the striatum or thalamus.some studies have also found that pallidotomy can improve gait and balance and reduce the amount of levodopa people require, thus reducing drug-induced dyskinesias.another procedure, called thalamotomy, involves surgically destroying part of the thalamus; this approach is useful primarily to reduce tremor. because these procedures cause permanent destruction of brain tissue, they have largely been replaced by deep brain stimulation for treatment of pd. deep brain stimulation. deep brain stimulation, or dbs, uses an electrode surgically implanted into part of the brain, typically the subthalamic nucleus or the globus pallidus.similar to a cardiac pacemaker, a pulse generator (battery pack) that is implanted in the chest area under the collarbone sends finely controlled electrical signals to the electrode(s) via a wire placed under the skin. when turned on using an external wand, the pulse generator and electrodes painlessly stimulate the brain in a way that helps to block signals that cause many of the motor symptoms of pd. dbs is approved by the u.s. food and drug administration and is widely used as a treatment for pd. dbs can be used on one or both sides of the brain.if it is used on just one side, it will affect symptoms on the opposite side of the body. dbs is primarily used to stimulate one of three brain regions:the subthalamic nucleus, the globus pallidus interna, or the thalamus.however, the subthalamic nucleus, a tiny area located beneath the thalamus, is the most common target.stimulation of either the globus pallidus or the subthalamic nucleus can reduce tremor, bradykinesia, and rigidity.stimulation of the thalamus is useful primarily for reducing tremor. people who initially responded well to treatment with levodopa tend to respond well to dbs.while the motor function benefits of dbs can be substantial, it usually does not help with speech problems, "freezing," posture, balance, anxiety, depression, or dementia. one advantage of dbs compared to pallidotomy and thalamotomy is that the electrical current can be turned off using a handheld device.the pulse generator also can be externally programmed. individuals must return to the medical center frequently for several months after dbs surgery in order to have the stimulation adjusted by trained doctors or other medical professionals.the pulse generator must be programmed very carefully to give the best results.doctors also must supervise reductions in medications.after a few months, the number of medical visits usually decreases significantly, though individuals may occasionally need to return to the center to have their stimulator checked. also, the battery for the pulse generator must be surgically replaced every three to five years, though externally rechargeable batteries may eventually become available. dbs does not stop pd from progressing, and some problems may gradually return.dbs is not a good option for everyone.it is generally appropriate for people with levodopa-responsive pd who have developed dyskinesias or other disabling "off" symptoms despite drug therapy.it is not generally an option for people with memory problems, hallucinations, severe depression, poor health, or a poor response to levodopa.dbs has not been demonstrated to be of benefit for "atypical" parkinsonian syndromes such as multiple system atrophy, progressive supranuclear palsy, or post-traumatic parkinsonism. as with any brain surgery, dbs has potential complications, including stroke or brain hemorrhage.these complications are rare, however.there is also a risk of infection, which may require antibiotics or even replacement of parts of the dbs system.researchers are continuing to study dbs and to develop ways of improving it. a two-part study funded by the ninds and the department of veterans affairs first compared bilateral dbs to best medical therapy, including medication adjustment and physical therapy. bilateral dbs showed overall superiority to best medical therapy at improving motor symptoms and quality of life. the second part of the study, involving nearly 300 patients, compared subthalamic nucleus (stn) dbs to globus pallidus interna (gpi) dbs. the two groups reported similar improvements in motor control and quality of life in scores on the unified parkinsons disease rating scale.on a variety of neuropsychological tests, there were no significant differences between the two groups.however, the stn dbs group experienced a greater decline on a test of visuomotor processing speed, which measures how quickly someone thinks and acts on information. also, the stn dbs group had slight worsening on a standard assessment of depression, while the gpi dbs group had slight improvement on the same test. the importance of these two differences is not clear, and will be scrutinized in follow-up research, the investigators say.other clinical studies hope to determine the best part of the brain to receive stimulation and to determine the long-term effects of this therapy. they also are working to improve the technology used in dbs. complementary and supportive therapies a wide variety of complementary and supportive therapies may be used for pd. among these therapies are standard physical, occupational, and speech therapy techniques, which can help with such problems as gait and voice disorders, tremors and rigidity, and cognitive decline.other types of supportive therapies include the following: diet. at this time there are no specific vitamins, minerals, or other nutrients that have any proven therapeutic value in pd. a ninds clinical study of the dietary supplement coenzyme q10 was stopped in 2011 when results from an interim analysis showed active treatment with the supplement was unlikely to demonstrate a statistically significant difference than from a placebo.the ninds and other components of the national institutes of health are funding research to determine if caffeine, antioxidants, and other dietary factors may be beneficial for preventing or treating pd. while there is currently no proof that any specific dietary factor is beneficial, a normal, healthy diet can promote overall well-being for people with pd just as it would for anyone else. eating a fiber-rich diet and drinking plenty of fluids also can help alleviate constipation.a high protein diet, however, may limit levodopa's absorption, highlighting the importance of the timing of medications. exercise. exercise can help people with pd improve their mobility and flexibility. some doctors prescribe physical therapy or muscle-strengthening exercises to tone muscles and to put underused and rigid muscles through a full range of motion. the effects of exercise on disease progression are not known, but it may improve body strength so that the person is less disabled. exercises also improve balance, helping people minimize gait problems, and can strengthen certain muscles so that people can speak and swallow better. exercise can also improve the emotional well-being of people with pd, and more general physical activity, such as walking, gardening, swimming, calisthenics, and using exercise machines, also is beneficial.people with pd should always check with their doctors before beginning a new exercise program. other complementary therapies that are used by some individuals with pd include massage therapy, yoga, tai chi, hypnosis, acupuncture, and the alexander technique, which optimizes posture and muscle activity. another important therapeutic approach involves speech and swallowing evaluation and therapy.certain techniques can help with the low voice volume that patients with parkinsons often experience. how can people cope with parkinson's disease? while pd usually progresses slowly, eventually daily routines may be affectedfrom socializing with friends to earning a living and taking care of a home.these changes can be difficult to accept.support groups can help people cope with the disease emotionally.these groups also can provide valuable information, advice, and experience to help people with pd, their families, and their caregivers deal with a wide range of issues, including locating doctors familiar with the disease and coping with physical limitations. a list of national organizations that can help patients locate support groups in their communities appears at the end of this information. individual or family counseling also may help people find ways to cope with pd. people with pd also can benefit from being proactive and finding out as much as possible about the disease in order to alleviate fear of the unknown and to take a positive role in maintaining their health.many people with pd continue to work either full- or part-time, although they may need to adjust their schedule and working environment to accommodate their symptoms. can scientists predict or prevent parkinson's disease? in most cases, there is no way to predict or prevent sporadic pd. however, researchers are looking for a biomarkera biological abnormality that all people with pd might sharethat could be picked up by screening techniques or by a simple chemical test given to people who do not have any parkinsonian symptoms.this could help doctors identify people at risk of the disease.it also might allow them to find treatments that will stop the disease process in the early stages. one important area of research in this domain involves imaging techniques, such as special mri techniques or nuclear imaging techniques currently under study at the national institutes of health and elsewhere. in rare cases, where people have a clearly inherited form of pd, researchers can test for known gene mutations as a way of determining an individual's risk of the disease.however, this genetic testing can have far-reaching implications and people should carefully consider whether they want to know the results of such tests. what research is being done? the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke (ninds), part of the national institutes of health (nih), is the leading u.s. funder of research on parkinsons disease (pd).the institute conducts and supports three types of research: basicscientific discoveries in the lab, clinicaldeveloping and studying therapeutic approaches to parkinsons disease, and translationalfocused on tools and resources that speed the development of therapeutics into practice.the goals of ninds-supported research are to better understand and diagnose pd, develop new treatments, and ultimately, prevent pd.ninds also supports training for the next generation of pd researchers and clinicians, and serves as an important source of information for people with pd and their families. the parkinsons disease biomarkers programs (pdbp), a major ninds initiative, is aimed at discovering ways to identify individuals at risk for developing pd and to track the progression of the disease.identifying biomarkers (signs that may indicate risk of a disease and improve diagnosis) will speed the development of novel therapeutics for pd.six projects are actively recruiting volunteers at sites across the u.s.the ninds also collaborates with the michael j. fox foundation for parkinsons research (mjff) on biofind, a project collecting biological samples and clinical data from healthy volunteers and those with pd.for more information about the pdpb and how you can get involved, please visit the pdbp website at the ninds morris k. udall centers of excellence for parkinsons disease research programa central component of ninds pd researchwas established in 1997 to find the fundamental causes of pd and better diagnose and treat people with pd.the ninds currently funds 10 udall centers across the country, where researchers are examining pd disease mechanisms, the genetic contributions to pd, and potential therapeutic targets and treatment strategies.to learn more about the ninds udall centers, see parkinsons disease clinical studies offer an opportunity to help researchers find better ways to safely detect, treat, or prevent pd and therefore hope for individuals now and in the future.ninds conducts clinical studies on parkinsons disease at the nih research campus in bethesda, maryland, and supports pd studies at medical research centers throughout the united states.but studies can be completed only if people volunteer to participate.by participating in a clinical study, healthy individuals and people living with parkinsons disease can greatly benefit the lives of those affected by this disorder.talk with your doctor about clinical studies and help to make the difference in improving the quality of life for all people with parkinsons disease.for more information about ninds clinical trials on pd, see studies include genetics and pd, search for pd biomarkers, experimental therapies and other treatment options, diagnostic imaging, brain control and movement disorders, dbs, and exercise and pd. animal models: these are invaluable tools for scientists studying disease mechanisms to develop new treatments for people with pd. for example, a recently completed study of the drug isradipinewhich had been shown in animal models to have a protective effect on dopaminergic neuronsfound a similar neuroprotective effect in humans. cognition and dementia:mild cognitive impairment is common in pd, sometimes in its early stages, and some people develop dementia in the diseases later stages.the ninds has funded research using neuroimaging to predict which individuals with pd might develop cognitive impairment. deep brain stimulation (dbs):ninds has been a pioneer in the study and development of dbs, which is now considered a standard treatment option for some people living with pd whose symptoms no longer respond to pd medications.while nih supported research on brain circuitry was critical to the development of dbs, ninds research continues to fine-tune the optimal site within the brain to implant the dbs electrode to help even more people with pd regain function. dyskinesia: involuntary movement, tremor, and motor response complications become evident as pd progresses.ninds scientists have studied the safety and effectiveness of drugs in alleviating movement disorders in persons with pd. a current clinical study is evaluating the effectiveness of botulinum toxin in treating a variety of movement disorders, including pd.for more information, see environmental studies:risk factors such as repeated occupational exposure to certain pesticides and chemical solvents may influence who develops pd.a ninds-funded research consortium is hunting for environmental risk factors that increase susceptibility to developing pd before age 50.for example, ninds-funded researchers analyzed the occupational histories of twins in which one of the pair developed pd.based on estimates of exposure to six chemicals previously linked to pd, the researchers concluded that two of the common solvents were significantly linked to development of pd. (see exercise:exercise routines are often recommended to help individuals with pd maintain movement and balance necessary for everyday living.a recent ninds-funded study evaluated three different forms of exerciseresistance training, stretching, and tai chiand found that tai chi led to the greatest overall improvements in balance and stability for people with mild to moderate pd.a current trial is studying the effects of two levels of exercise in people who have been recently diagnosed with pd. for more information, see genetic studies:a better understanding of genetic risk factors is playing a critical role in elucidating pd disease mechanisms.a 2011 ninds workshop led to an analysis of data from pd genome-wide studies around the world, to correlate genetic variants and common traits among people with pd.the workshop contributed to the development of neurox, the first dna chip that can identify genetic changes in persons at risk for a number of late-onset neurodegenerative diseases, including pd.another ninds collaborative, the consortium on risk for early-onset parkinson's disease (core pd), hopes to identify the genetic factors that contribute to the development of early-onset pd.current clinical studies include: the genetic connection to memory and motor behavior; the search for genes that may increase the risk of pd and related neurodegenerative disorders; and identifying biomarkers for pd.for more information on these studies, see mitochondria: these cellular energy factories may play a central role in pd. ninds-funded scientists have found that hundreds of genes involved in mitochondrial function are less active in people with pd.drugs that target genes involved in mitochondrial function could perhaps slow progression of the disease. scientists funded by the ninds and the michael j. fox foundation are measuring the safety and effectiveness of oral doses of the drug pioglitazone on disease progression in individuals with pd.for more information and to participate in the trial, see nerve growth factors:growth factors are proteins involved in nervous system formation and are of interest to researchers studying neurodegenerative diseases. one small clinical trial will assess the safety, tolerability, and potential clinical effects of gene therapy with glial derived neurotrophic factor (gdnf)a protein that may help protect dopamine-producing nerve cells.this trial for individuals with advanced pd is based on ninds-sponsored research showing that an advanced technique for delivery of the gdnf gene into the brain improves the health and function of the dopamine neurons in animal models of pd.for more information, see stem cells:scientists are exploring various types of cells, including stem cells, as opportunities for pd drug discovery.stem cell technology could be used to define disease mechanisms and the most promising treatments for sporadic pd.to pursue this area of research, ninds established a pd cell research consortium in 2009 in collaboration with the michael j. fox foundation and the parkinsons disease foundation.for more information, see or where can i get more information?for more information on neurological disorders or research programs funded by the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke, contact the institute's brain resources and information network (brain) at: brain p.o. box 5801 bethesda, md 20824 (800) information also is available from the following organizations: column1 column2 american parkinson disease association135 parkinson avenuestaten island, ny tel: 718-981-8001 800-223-2732 young onset center: 877-223-3801 fax: 718-981-4399 national parkinson foundation201 se 1st streetsuite 800miami, fl tel: 800-473-4636 fax: 305-243-5595 parkinson alliancep.o. box 308kingston, nj tel: 609-688-0870 800-579-8440 fax: 609-688-0875 michael j. fox foundation for parkinson's researchgrand central stationp.o. box 4777new york, ny tel: 212-509-0995 parkinson's action network (pan)1025 vermont ave., nwsuite 1120washington, dc tel: 800-850-4726 202-638-4101 fax: 202-638-7257 parkinson's disease foundation (pdf)1359 broadwaysuite 1509new york, ny tel: 212-923-4700 800-457-6676 fax: 212-923-4778 the parkinson's institute and clinical center675 almanor avenuesunnyvale, ca tel: 408-734-2800 800-655-2273 fax: 408-734-8522 parkinson's resource organization74-090 el paseo, suite 104palm desert, ca tel: 760-773-5628 877-775-4111 877-775-4111 fax: 760-773-9803 bachmann-strauss dystonia parkinson foundationfred french building 551 fifth avenue, at 45th streetsuite 520new york, ny tel: 212-682-9900 fax: 212-987-0662 davis phinney foundation1722 14th street, suite 150boulder, co tel: 866-358-0285 303-733-3340 fax: 303-733-3350 glossary anticholinergic drugs drugs that interfere with production or uptake of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. akinesia trouble initiating or carrying out movements. bradykinesia gradual loss of spontaneous movement. corpus striatum a part of the brain that helps regulate motor activities. deep brain stimulation a treatment that uses an electrode implanted into part of the brain to stimulate it in a way that temporarily inactivates some of the signals it produces. dopamine a chemical messenger, deficient in the brains of pd patients, that transmits impulses from one nerve cell to another. dyskinesias abnormal involuntary twisting and writhing movements that can result from long-term use of high doses of levodopa. dystonia involuntary muscle contractions that cause slow repetitive movements or abnormal postures. dysphagia difficulty swallowing. myoclonus muscular jerks. neurotransmitters chemicals whichcarry messages from one nerve cell, or neuron, to another. pallidotomy a surgical procedure in which a part of the brain called the globus pallidus is lesioned in order to improve symptoms of tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia. parkinsonian gait a characteristic way of walking that includes a tendency to lean forward;
