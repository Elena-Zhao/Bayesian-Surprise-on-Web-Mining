gerd symptoms and celiac disease celiac disease and reflux weight and celiac disease untreated celiac disease and malnutrition lactose intolerance and celiac neurological celiac disease symptoms many people with undiagnosed celiac experience extreme fatigue that prevents them from performing everyday tasks and impacts their quality of life. generally, fatigue seems to creep up on you, making it easy to blame it on getting older. at the same time, insomnia and other sleep disorders are very common in people with celiac. in fact, one study compared celiacs at diagnosis and on a gluten-free diet with non-celiac controls, and found both untreated and treated celiacs fared worse on measures of sleep quality. it's the worst of both worlds: you're exhausted during the day, but can't fall asleep or stay asleep at night. in addition, many celiacs get brain fog due to gluten. when you have brain fog, you have trouble thinking clearly -- it literally feels as if your brain is operating in a fog. you might have trouble coming up with the right words to carry on an intelligent conversation, or you might misplace your car keys or fumble other common household tasks. some newly diagnosed celiacs already have diagnoses of migraine headaches; in many cases (but not all), these headaches will lessen in severity and frequency or even clear up completely once you adopt a gluten-free diet. psychological symptoms such as depression, anxiety and irritability occur frequently in people with undiagnosed celiac disease. in fact, long-diagnosed celiacs often can tell they've been exposed to gluten through their irritability -- that symptom can appear within hours of exposure and linger for several days. peripheral neuropathy, in which you experience numbness, a sensation of pins and needles and potentially weakness in your extremities, is one of the most frequently reported neurological symptoms of celiac disease. in addition, some people are diagnosed with gluten ataxia, a condition characterized by the loss of balance and coordination due to gluten consumption. restless leg syndrome even has been reported as a common symptom of celiac disease. in one study, 31% of celiacs had restless leg syndrome, compared with just 4% of control subjects. more on neurological symptoms in celiac disease: gluten-related neurological symptoms celiac disease and migraine gluten and sleep gluten and brain fog gluten and adhd gluten and depression gluten ataxia celiac disease in elderly patients complications of untreated celiac disease next: thyroid, joint, dental and skin symptoms, plus cancer risks previousnext12 related articlesceliac disease and constipation - a possible combination?inflammatory bowel diseaseceliac disease our expert recommends readers respond diagnosing celiac disease celiac blood tests endoscopy the gluten-free diet clean out your kitchen clean out your home celiac disease & gluten sensitivity essentials 9 surprising signs you may have a gluten allergy gluten sensitivity (gluten intolerance) celiac disease symptoms you might not realize you have celiac disease symptoms watch out for these gluten sensitivity symptoms gluten sensitivity (gluten intolerance) what's really involved in switching to a gluten-free diet?
