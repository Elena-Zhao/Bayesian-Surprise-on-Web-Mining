this causes stomach pains, diarrhoea, and weight loss. crohn's disease is a chronic or long term inflammatory disorder that predominately affects the gastro-intestinal tract. it is a type of inflammatory bowel disease. crohn's disease can affect any part of the gut from mouth to anus. commonly the inflammation affects the colon only (30 per cent), the end of the ileum or small intestine where it joins the colon (30 per cent) or it may involve both sites (40 per cent). crohn's disease however may produce symptoms outside the gut all together. the skin, joints, eyes and liver can be involved, making crohn's disease a 'multi-system' or generalised disease. crohn's disease is named after dr burrill b crohn, a new york doctor, who reported cases in the 1930s. what causes crohn's disease? the cause of crohn's disease is currently unknown. there are a number of theories, but the emerging theory is that crohn's disease is an abnormal immune response to the gut microflora (bacteria) in a person who is genetically susceptible. there are similarities to an intestinal infection similar to tuberculosis. some doctors, noting that crohn's disease seems to have become more common in the twentieth century, suggest a link with dietary factors in processed food or allergens, smoking or children not being exposed to various viruses or bacteria as they were in the past. there does appear to be a tendency for crohn's disease to run in families, although not in all patients. this suggests a genetic factor and a particular gene, called nod2, has been implicated. the nod2 gene codes for a protein that determines how the body reacts to bacteria found in the gut. however at present no clear cause for crohn's disease has been found. who gets crohn's disease? crohn's disease is less common than ulcerative colitis, the other major type of inflammatory bowel disease. men and women are affected equally. crohn's disease can occur at any age but there may be peaks at 15 to 30 years old and between 50 and 70 years old. certainly children, even at a very young age, can develop the disease. indeed, 20 per cent of crohn's disease patients are diagnosed before the age of 20. the disease is uncommon in non-white populations especially those in underdeveloped countries. rates are high in those of jewish descent. crohn's disease is more common in smokers. what are the symptoms of crohn's disease? there are many more potential symptoms in crohn's disease than in many gastrointestinal diseases. the inflammation in crohn's disease extends through the bowel wall leading to abscess formation or scarring and narrowing of the bowel known as stricture formation. in addition, symptoms will depend on the severity of the disease and which part of the bowel is affected. crohn's disease may even come to notice through the skin, joint, eyes or liver disease known as 'extra-intestinal' manifestations. the commonest symptoms of crohn's disease are: diarrhoea this occurs in 70 per cent of patients. blood, mucus or pus may be present in the stool especially if the crohn's disease affects the colon. frequently however blood is not present. abdominal pain pain is almost as common as diarrhoea. the most frequently affected part of the bowel is in the lower right corner of the abdomen. the pain can be mild or so severe emergency surgery is required. many crohn's disease patients are only diagnosed after surgery undertaken for another reason, often appendicitis. weight loss unintentional weight loss despite a reasonable diet is a feature of patients with crohn's disease. anal problems infection, abscess formation and deep fissures or cracks around the anus are characteristic of crohn's and may be the first signs of the disease. anaemia and nutritional deficiencies inflamed crohn's disease can bleed into the gut leading to anaemia, particularly iron deficiency. other vitamins, especially b12, and fat may also fail to be absorbed if the disease is extensive. patients with crohn's disease often feel generally unwell and tired as a result. 'extra-intestinal' manifestations occasionally the main symptoms of crohn's disease may be outside the gut in the skin, eyes, joints or liver. only careful investigation may revealed the true underlying gut disease. how can crohn's disease be prevented? crohn's disease cannot be prevented. no diet has been found to stop crohn's disease occurring. how is crohn's disease diagnosed? crohn's disease may be easy or extremely difficult to diagnose. symptoms of crohn's disease over-lap with many gut diseases particularly ulcerative colitis, colon cancer or even irritable bowel syndrome (ibs). blood tests may show anaemia, vitamin deficiencies or inflammation increasing suspicion of crohn's disease. patients with disease in the colon are usually diagnosed by colonoscopy. a flexible tube, called a colonoscope or endoscope, is passed around the colon via the anus. colonoscopy allows direct views of the colon and biopsies or specimens can be taken to confirm crohn's disease. colonoscopy may also view the end of the small intestine or terminal ileum, part of the bowel frequently affected by crohn's disease. barium enema is now rarely used to diagnose crohn's disease. small bowel crohns disease is more difficult to diagnose. x-rays of the small bowel with barium taken by mouth can be used. computerised tomography (ct) can also be useful. an mri scan of the small bowel called an mr enterography (mre) allows the assessment of the thickness of the small bowel without exposure to ionising radiation. direct endoscopy of the small bowel (enteroscopy) is difficult but can be performed both via the mouth or anus. a newer technique called a capsule endoscopy where a capsule with a small camera is swallowed and allowed to progress through the bowel, transmitting signals to a receiver outside the body may diagnose difficult cases. recently, a stool test called faecal calprotectin can be used to distinguish whether diarrhoea is caused by inflammation or is caused by irritable bowel syndrome. what diet is recommended in crohn's disease? there is no specific recommended for all patients with crohn's disease. general nutrition is important with adequate, easily absorbed nutrients especially after intestinal surgery. a low fat diet may reduce diarrhoeal symptoms. supplements for specific vitamin deficiencies such a iron b12 and folate should be given. how is crohn's disease treated? crohn's disease has periods of relapse (or active disease) and remission (when the symptoms are quiet) but there is no long term cure. the object of management is to treat periods of relapse to produce remission and then maintain the disease in an inactive state. any complications encountered will need to be specifically overcome. treatment is difficult and needs specialist advice. generally a combination of medical treatment with drugs and surgery will be required in the majority of patients. treatment will depend on site and extent of disease, severity of symptoms and the patients wishes. medical treatment: medicines commonly used in crohn's disease include: 5-aminosalycylic acid (5-asa) 5-asa drugs such as mesalazine (asacol) are occasionally used in crohns disease, but the evidence suggests that in general this class of drug is not effective for active crohn's disease. in addition, the 5-asa group of drugs may help to maintain remission particularly after surgery but the data is not conclusive. 5-asa enemas may help control local rectal crohn's disease. children with crohns disease respond well to nutritional therapy (elemental diet). adults do not seem to respond as well to children and generally nutritional therapy is used as adjunctive therapy in this group. corticosteroids the main stay of treatment for active crohn's disease are corticosteroids which suppress inflammation. in severe cases intravenous treatment with hydrocortisone in hospital may be needed. most patients use oral steroid preparations particularly prednisolone starting with a high dose and gradually reducing. budesonide a newer corticosteroid can be prescribed as it is believed to have fewer side-effects. serious side-effects, particularly osteoporosis limit the long term use of corticosteroids. immunosuppressants in patients with crohn's disease that recurs quickly when the steroids are reduced, azathioprine (eg imuran) (or its similar drug 6-metacaptopurine (6mp) is often prescribed. use of these drugs allow the steroid dosage to be reduced. however azathioprine has its own side-effects including liver and bone marrow toxicity and very careful medical supervision is required with these drugs. methotrexate, another immunosuppressant, can substitute if azathioprine is not suitable but this is not thought to be as effective as either azathioprine or 6mp. over the last 10 years a new class of drugs have been available to treat patients with crohn's disease called monoclonal antibodies. the first in this class is infliximab (remicade) and is widely used in patients with severe crohns disease. it acts as a powerful immunosuppressive drug by blocking an important chemical in the blood which causes inflammation called tnf-. this drug can increase a persons chance of developing lots of different infections and must only be prescribed by physicians who have experience managing patients with severe crohns disease. other drugs of this class used in inflammatory bowel disease include adalimumab (humira), certolizumab (cimzia) and golimumab (simponi). what can be done at home? watch out for signs indicating that the disease is becoming worse: blood in the stools new or different abdominal pain a fever which cannot be attributed to anything else unexplained weight loss occasionally extreme fatigue alone can herald the onset of active disease joint pains (polyarthralgia) can indicate active inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract. if you have these symptoms, contact your doctor. activity acute attacks require rest. in periods of remission, the patient should try to resume their normal activities. diet normally, there are no restrictions but, as with other intestinal diseases, a low-fat and low residue diet may reduce the person's diarrhoea. many patients report an improvement in their symptoms when they reduce consumption of lactose based food (eg milk, cheese and yoghurt). but no controlled trials have consistently demonstrated improvement in crohns disease activity scores with low lactose based diets. what are the complications of crohn's disease? stricturing (narrowing) of the bowel caused by long standing inflammation and scarring can cause bowel obstruction. bleeding. severe diarrhoea (this may have a number of different causes and may not be due to active disease alone). iron deficiency and other vitamin deficiencies, especially vitamin b12. ileus (reduced bowel mobility), or obstruction (partial or complete blockage of the intestine). perforation of the inflamed intestines or formation of fistulas. inflammation of the liver, joints and eyes, and skin rash. problems with digestion of food, either due to extensive scarring in the intestine, or because the intestine has become too short after a number of operations. prognosis the above symptoms notwithstanding, most patients lead normal lives. how is crohn's disease treated? the treatment depends on the severity and extent of the disease, as well as the effect of the disease on the patient. medication can in many cases control the inflammation, keep the symptoms down, and reduce the probability of relapse. surgical removal of the affected areas is sometimes necessary, but the disease can recur elsewhere. there is an 80 per cent life-time risk of the need for surgery in those with crohns disease. severe attacks require treatment in hospital. other people also read: blood tests: how is a blood test carried out?
