(there isnot a clear consensus among writers here.) one important andcontroversial question is whether the judgments we make concerningour biology are also normative in some way. a further large questionconcerns the relationship between the two types of judgments, in bothmedicine and common sense. another strain in recent scholarship suggests that our normativejudgments alone determine who falls under the concepts of health anddisease. this view has been less influential in philosophy, butcommands widespread adherence in other areas of the humanities andsocial sciences (e.g. kennedy 1983, brown 1990). kitcher (1997,2089) summarizes the debate as follows:some scholars, objectivists about disease, think that there are factsabout the human body on which the notion of disease is founded, andthat those with a clear grasp of those facts would have no troubledrawing lines, even in the challenging cases. their opponents,constructivists about disease, maintain that this is an illusion, thatthe disputed cases reveal how the values of different social groupsconflict, rather than exposing any ignorance of facts, and thatagreement is sometimes even produced because of universal acceptanceof a system of values.kitcher's objectivism and constructivism are often called naturalismand normativism. but since both naturalism andnormativism are used in other senses in a variety ofdebates, this essay will use kitcher's terminology. after a moreelaborate taxonomy of analyses of disease, forms of constructivism andthe difficulties they face will be discussed. then objectivism will besimilarly treated, before the discussion moves to health.kitcher's claim that an objectivist analysis is groundedon facts about the human body is perhaps not as clear as it mightbe. before arriving at some qualifications, then, we should havestraightforward statements of objectivism and constructivism inhand. (although, since the qualifications are not yet in place,perhaps no theorist would fully endorse these bald versions of thepositions.)the objectivist conception of disease (perhaps most clearly stated inboorse 1975,1997) is that the human body comprises many organ systemsthat have natural functions from which they can depart in manyways. some of these departures from normal functioning are harmless orbeneficial, but others are not. the latter are diseases.so to call something a disease involves both a claim about theabnormal functioning of some bodily system and a judgment that theresulting abnormality is a bad one. objectivists contend that thedetermination of bodily malfunction is an objective matter to bedetermined by science. they may also argue (boorse 1997) thatdetermining whether a malfunction is detrimental to human well-beingis also an objective matter, but more usually they concede thatnormative considerations are the basis for that judgment. so theobjectivist position is that a disease is a bodily malfunction thatcauses one's life to deteriorate.this malfunction could take manyforms: it is not a necessary part of the objectivist case thatdiseases constitute a natural kind.rather, they could be a set of naturally occurring processes that areheld together in virtue of our interest in grouping them as aclass. kinds that work like this include weed orvermin (murphy 2006): the existence of the superordinateclass depends on human interests but the subordinate members arenatural kinds whose natures can be investigated scientifically.constructivism, however, argues that human interests do not justdefine the superordinate class of disease. human interests, ratherthan biological malfunctions, also explain the judgments thatsubordinate members have the relevant biological character. althoughconstructivists accept that disease categories refer to known orunknown biological processes they deny that these processes can beidentified independently of human values by, for example,a science ofnormal human nature. constructivist conceptions of disease arenormative through and through, although the precise account of therelevant norms will vary between scholars.the key constructivist contention is that there is no natural,objectively definable set of human malfunctions that necessarily causedisease. rather, constructivists assert that to call a condition adisease is to make a judgment that someone in that condition isundergoing a specific kind of harm that we explain in terms of bodilyprocesses. but the bodily processes are not objectivelymalfunctioning; rather, they are merely judged by us to be unusual orabnormal because they depart from some shared, usually culturallyspecific, conception of human nature. the crucial difference betweenthe positions then is that for an objectivist, diseases areobjectively malfunctioning biological processes that cause harms. fora constructivist, diseases are harms that we blame on some biologicalprocess because it causes the harm, not because it is objectivelydysfunctional.however, constructivism is hard to define satisfactorily, for tworeasons. first, its core claim is a denial of the objectivist thesisthat disease necessarily involves bodily malfunction. since there aremany views one might hold about the nature of the biological processesinvolved in disease that are compatible with the denial ofmalfunction, the positive constructivist claim varies across theoriesand is often elusive. reznek (1987) for example, explicitly deniesthat malfunction is a necessary condition for disease. he does assert(ch 9) that diseases involve abnormal bodily processes,but he does not say what that means. constructivists often, as we willsee later, argue that disease judgments appeal to biological processesthat are to be understood in terms of human practices rather thanmembership in some biologically definable class of abnormalities ormalfunctions. we have decided that some harmful conditions are theprovince of the medical profession, and those are diseases.that brings up the second reason why constructivism can be an elusivetarget: it has often rested on (perfectly reasonable) claims about therole that value judgments have played in medical practice, or on theprevalence of culturally specific disagreements about abnormal humanbehavior or physiology. this means, as we shall see, thatconstructivists, especially in the social sciences, do not tend tooffer necessary and sufficient conditions. rather, they often seek toreconstruct the concept of disease as revealed by ourpractices. constructivism, therefore, often looks like a thesis abouthow inquiry is carried on: first we identify a condition we disvalue,then we look for a biological process that causes it and say that,whatever it is, it is abnormal. this stress on our practices is acommon constructivist trope, whereas objectivists more often seek toanalyse a concept that will clarify what disease really is, howeverfumbling and biased our attempts to uncover it may have been.that both medical practice and lay thought shape disease concepts isundeniable. because of this, we need to introduce a seconddistinction. both objectivism and constructivism can take either arevisionist or a conservative form. a conservative view says that ourfolk concept of illness should constrain a theoretical picture ofhealth and disease worked out by scientists and clinicians. arevisionist thinks that our existing concepts should be amended in thelight of what inquiry uncovers. one could be a conservative orrevisionist objectivist, as well as a conservative or revisionistconstructivist.health and disease, like many other concepts, are neither purelyscientific nor exclusively a part of common sense. they have a home inboth scientific theories and everyday thought. that raises a problemfor any philosophical account: suppose we try to say what health anddisease really amount to, from which it follows that the scientificconcept should fit the facts about world. if the picture we end upwith deviates too far from folk thought, should we worry? you mightthink that everyday language puts constraints on a concept of healththat need to respected, and that if we move too far from ordinaryusage we have stopped talking about health and started talking aboutsomething else. furthermore, it is not really possible to argue thatscientific and vernacular uses of the concepts are fully independent,since the development of science influences everyday thought, and manyscientific concepts begin in pre-scientific contexts and carry themarks of those origins deep into their careers.furthermore, the concept of disease that is currently employed in mostareas of medicine has undergone a process of development. for much ofthe modern era there has been a dialectic between two concepts ofdisease. on the one hand, there has been the idea that a disease isjust an observable suite of symptoms with a predictable courseunfolding. this notion dates back to sydenham in the late seventeenthcentury. kraepelin applied it to psychiatry as the basis fordifferential diagnosis, for example between hebephrenia and dementiapraecox (schizophrenia) (1899, 173175). the approach was supplantedas medicine matured by the concept of diseases as destructiveprocesses in bodily organs which divert part of the substanceof the individual from the actions which are natural to the species toanother kind of action (snow 1853, 155; for discussion seewhitbeck 1977, carter 2003, broome 2006). this is perhaps still thecore medical conception of disease. it is a strong interpretation ofobjectivism, which seeks explanations that cite pathological processesin bodily systems. more recent medicine has tended to weaken thisslightly by adopting what green (2007, ch, 2) calls anactuarial model of disease. this model takes thepresence of elevated risk, for example as indicated by high bloodpressure, to be a disease even in the absence of overt symptoms or aclearly destructive pathological process.medicine recognizes illnesses like hypertension and cushing'sdisease that are the outcome of systems in a poorly regulated statethat is stable, albeit suboptimal. the idea of a specific pathogenicprocess in medicine includes dysregulation, but this may not accordwith folk thought.modern medicine is objectivist. one question, then, concerns theextent to which common sense and biomedical concepts arerelated. perhaps both have objectivist commitments, or perhaps commonsense is driven by values and medicine is not, or perhaps physiciansare really constructivists who are self-deceived or arguing in badfaith.there is little reason to expect scientific and common sense conceptsto agree in general, so if medicine and everyday thought disagreeabout disease, we may ask which concept should be adopted. if we wishto distil a concept that can play a role in medical inquiry, we mayside with the scientists. but such proposals, which argue for a sharpseparation between scientific and folk uses, are not neutral pieces ofobservation about the language. they are proposals for purging sciencefrom commonsense constraints that hinder its development. arevisionist view of this sort, in this case, says that our concepts ofhealth and disease might be a necessary starting point but should notconstrain where the inquiry ends up. other forms of revisionism arepossible. a revisionist objectivist argues that we should follow thescience where it takes us and come up with concepts that furtherscientific inquiry, for example, even if that means that we eventuallyuse the language in ways that look bizarre from the standpoint ofcurrent common sense. but a revisionist constructivist could arguethat our thought, whether medical or lay, should be reformed in theservice of other goals, such as emancipation for hitherto oppressedgroups. such revisionist thought was important in overturning thepsychiatric view, dominant until the 1970s, that homosexuality is amental illness. activists argued that homosexuality was diagnosed foroffensive moral reasons and not for medical ones and was changed as aresult of lobbying on moral grounds rather than on the basis of anynew discovery. objectivists will respond that this was not an exampleof using constructivism for emancipatory ends, but of bringingpsychiatrists to understand that they were not obeying their ownobjectivist principles, and showing them that there is no good reasonto retain the diagnosis. much debate between objectivist andconstructivists involves competing histories in just thisway. constructivists strive to uncover the role that moral and socialvalues have always played in medical diagnosis and argue that ourdisease categories are hence not properly objectivist. objectivists,though they must concede that many diagnoses have been based on moralvalues that we would now renounce, still insist that the concept ofdisease, when correctly applied, as it often is, is thoroughlyobjectivist and not impugned by past failures by the medicalprofession to live up to its own scientific ambitions.objectivists tend towards conceptual conservatism. they typicallyappeal to our intuitions about illness as support for their ownemphasis on underlying bodily malfunction. this assumes that ourcurrent concept is in good shape and that common sense and medicineshare a concept of disease, and that medicine should respect layintuitions about what is and what is not a disease. like manyphilosophers who think about other concepts with both scientific andcommon sense uses, conservative objectivists about disease think thatfolk concepts specify what counts as health and disease. the job ofmedicine is to look at the world and see if anything in nature fallsunder the concept as revealed by analysis (cf the canberraplan of jackson 1998) for revisionists, this understanding ofcommon sense's relations to science is needlessly submissive to folkintuitions.revisionist objectivists argue that facts about physiological andpsychological functioning, like other biological facts, obtainindependently of human conceptions of the world. our intuitions mighttell us that a condition is not a disease. but scientific inquirymight conclude that people with the condition are really sufferingfrom a biological malfunction. in that case, a conservative wouldrecommend finessing the analysis to ensure that the concept of diseasedoes not cover this case. a revisionist would say that we must bitethe bullet and judge that this case falls under the concept even ifthat judgment is counterintuitive. a revisionist objectivist regardshealth and disease as features of the world to be discovered bybiomedical investigation, and therefore loosely constrained, at best,by our everyday concepts of health and disease.constructivists are usually revisionists. they tend to say thatconcepts of health and disease medicalize behavior that breaks normsor fails in some way to accord with our values; we don't like pain, sopainful states count as diseases: we don't like fat people or drunks,so obesity and alcoholism count as diseases. constructivists willoften make this case with special vigor when it comes to mentaldisorder. constructivists are often social scientists and their interests maynot map neatly on to philosophical concerns. they are not usuallyinterested in conceptual analysis so much as in tracing the socialprocesses by which categories are formulated and changed overtime. conrad (2007, 78), for example, says he is notinterested in adjudicating whether any particular problem is really amedical problem i am interested in the social underpinnings ofthis expansion of medical jurisdiction.but constructivists often present their theories as unmasking commonsense or medical conceptions of disease, and hence as a kind ofrevisionism. they may accept that diagnoses of ill-health involveobjective facts that people appeal to, or presume that they can appealto, when they say that somebody is sick. the assumption in a societymight be that germs or other medically relevant causal factors arepresent in a person and have given rise to visible phenomena thatindicate ill-health. but a constructivist will claim that the actual,often unacknowledged, judgments driving the initial assertion thatsomeone is unhealthy are derived from social norms. we may discoverfacts about obesity and its relationship to blood pressure or lifeexpectancy. but the constructivist says that our search for therelevant biological findings is undertaken because we have alreadydecided that fat people are disgusting and we are trying to find a setof medically significant properties in order to make our wish tostigmatize them look like a medical decision rather than a moral oraesthetic one. the crucial constructivist claim is that we look forthe biological facts that ground disease judgments selectively, basedon prior condemnations of some people and not others. because theyclaim that social norms rather than disinterested inquiry drivemedicine (and especially, psychiatry), constructivists tend to berevisionists about folk concepts, bringing to light the unacknowledgedsources of our concepts of health and disease. but constructivismcould be a conservative view, aimed at uncovering our folk theory ofhealth and disease. a constructivist who takes this view says that ourfolk concept of disease is that of a pattern of behavior or bodilyactivity that violates social norms.one could be a constructivist about some diseases, and an objectivistabout others. for example, one could be an objectivist about bodilydisease but a constructivist about psychiatry. thomas szasz (1960,1973, 1987), for instance, is usually read as a constructivist whodenies that mental illness exists. but in fact szasz has a very strictobjectivist concept of disease as no more than damage to bodilystructures.he argues that mental disorders cannot exist because they are not theresult of tissue damage. he is an objectivist about disease, whichleads him to deny that mental illness is real and to offer aconstructivist and revisionist analysis of our psychiatricpractices. and indeed claims that we are merely taking conduct wedon't like and calling it pathological are more plausible inpsychiatry than in other parts of medicine, since there is a longhistory of psychiatrists who have done just that. samuel cartwrightargued in 1843 that american slaves who tried to escape were afflictedwith drapetomania or the disease causing slavesto run away (cartwright 2004, 33); slaves were also founduniquely prone to dyesthaesia aethiopica, which madethem neglect the property rights of their masters (brown1990). nineteenth century physicians regularly practicedcliterodectomy to cure women of sexual desire, which everybody knewnever afflicted normal females of good family (reznek 1987,56). more recently, soviet psychiatrists found that politicaldissidents suffered from sluggish schizophrenia. andhorwitz and wakefield (2007) have suggested that depression has beenseverely overdiagnosed by recent generations of americanpsychiatrists, leading to the pathologizing of ordinary sadness.our current taxonomy of illness could involve both objectivistintuitions about some conditions and constructivist rationalizationsabout others. you could use this depiction of everyday thought as apremise in an argument for revisionism, on the grounds that our folkconcepts are too confused to serve as constraints (murphy 2006 makesthis argument with respect to psychiatry).3. problems for constructivismconstructivism seems correct about some diseases; that is, we havethought that some human activities were pathological because of valuesrather than scientific evidence. however, it is another task to showthat constructivism is correct about our concept of disorder. and thiswould be true even if there were no diseases; it might still be thatcase that our concept of disorder is objectivist even if nothing fallsunder it. there are no unicorns, but an analysis of the concept ofunicorn that says that unicorns are giant purple cows that live onhuman flesh would be a faulty analysis all the same.the chief problem for constructivism is that we routinely make adistinction between the sick and the deviant, or between pathologicalconditions and those that we just disapprove of. our disease conceptscannot just be matter of disvaluing certain people or theirproperties. it must involve a reason for disvaluing them in a medicalway rather than some other way. illness has never been the only way tobe deviant. so szasz is just wrong to claim that when a person doessomething bad, like shoot the president, it is immediately assumedthat he might be mad (1974, 91). most of the time when people dobad things nobody doubts their sanity, just their morals. physicallyor mentally ill people, even if they are seen as norm-breakers, areseen as a distinctive class of norm-breakers. what's distinctive aboutthem?but the problem is that we routinely judge that people are worse offwithout thinking they are ill in any wayfor example, the ugly,the poor, people with no sense of humor or lousy taste or a propensityfor destructive relationships. we don't treat these judgments ofcomparative disadvantage as a prelude to medical inquiry, so why do wedo so in some other cases?notice that the problem is not just one of establishing that someoneis badly off or is in some other disvalued state. rather, the troubleis caused by the requirement that someone is badly off in a specific,health-related or medically significant way. rachel cooper, forexample (2002, 27274), analyzes the concept of disease as a badthing to have that is judged to require medical attention. she dealswith the objection that specifying when someone is badly off is verydifficult. cooper admits that it is a hard problem, but replies that itis a widespread problem, one which crops up in many areas of moralphilosophy.this response is correct as a general point but does not touch thepresent objection. the objection is not that it is hard to say whensomeone is badly off, but that it is hard to isolate the specificclass of ways of being badly off that we regard as medically relevantwithout relying on a notion of natural malfunction.john harris, for example, posits an er test (2007, 91)according to which we can think of a disorder as a condition thatmakes someone worse off and is such that emergency room personnelwould be negligent if they did not remedy it if they could. but as itstands the er test is much too broad. taken literally the er testsrequires medical personnel to teach the local language to immigrantswhose lives are worsened by a lack of competence in it. a generaltheory of ill-being would be as desirable as a theory ofwell-being. but without further elaboration it would not discriminatebetween medical and non-medical forms of ill-being. cooper and harrisface the difficulty of specifying what is distinctively medical aboutthe conditions that we expect medical personnel to treat: of course, athesis about what counts as a medical intervention that was put interms of combating disease or pathology would be circular. reznek(1987, 163) argues that we can delimit a purely medical sphereenumeratively without reference to the concept ofdiseasein terms of pharmacological and surgicalinterventions. however, as we saw at the start of this essay, alot of medical attention is directed at conditions which we do notcall diseases. prescribing contraceptive pills is a pharmacologicalintervention, but it is not directed against a disease; going on thepill is not like beginning a course of anti-malarial tablets.the objectivist has an answer to the problem of specifying what makessome medical interventions directed against disease, viz. thatconditions which doctors treat are diseases in so far as they involvenatural malfunctions. the constructivist view is that the class ofwhat we call malfunctions is picked out by its involvement in medicalpractice, and not the other way round. cooper and harris try to basetheir analysis on our practices, but they are unable to distinguishmedical practices from non-medical ones.the constructivist needs to explain why the value judgments that wedirect at putative sick people form a special class of valuejudgments. and that explanation has to show, in addition, why we thinkthe conditions that we single out as diseases with those special valuejudgments are candidates for a particular set of causalexplanations. it's all very well to point out, as reznek does(p.88) that an etiology only explains a pathology if we have alreadydecided that it is a pathology. this is correct, but it dodges theconceptual question of why we first decide that only some people orconditions are pathological. the objectivist says this: we think somepeople are worse off because of special kind of causal process, namelya disturbance of normal physical or psychological processes. it isthat causal judgment that has conceptual priority, even if, as amatter of timing, the violation of a norm is what is detected first.note that it does not refute objectivism to point out that the conceptof disease is sometimes misapplied, so that we think people are sickbut discover that they are not. in such cases (e.g. homosexuality) theexplanation for why it happened may be that our values caused theinitial judgment, but that does not show that the concept of diseaseis constructivist, rather than objectivist. no concept is correctlyapplied every time.reznek, for instance, argues that to judge that homosexuality is adisease we first have to make a value-judgment. we have first to judgethat we would be worse off being homosexual (1987, 212). reznekthen says that we could discover that homosexuality is not a diseaseif we find out that it develops by a normal psychologicalprocess. reznek calls this is a form of constructivism (ornormativism, as in his terms) because value judgments have conceptualpriority: but in fact in the case he describes it seem that valuejudgments are actually only heuristics, drawing our attention towhether something might be wrong with someone. if the initial judgmentcan be overturned by a biological discovery, then it seems thatbiological facts are necessary for a final judgment, which is to saythat our concept of disease necessarily involves both biological andevaluative judgments. that is a version of objectivism, since thebiological facts are the ultimate foundation for the judgment.indeed, objectivism seems to explain why constructivistinterpretations are sometimes correct. we say now that homosexualitywas never a disease, and was just diagnosed on moral grounds, becauseit was not caused by malfunctions according to any even moderatelycorrect theory of human biology or psychology. values stopped peoplefrom getting the science right, but homosexuality was correctlyunderstood, and no longer seen as a disease, when the science was donein a properly disinterested way.objectivism embodies the important insight that we do in fact thinkthat disease involves a causal process that includes biologicalabnormalities. it does not mean, however, that all diseases have toreceive the same biological explanation. the class of diseases willinclude a variety of different conditions that receive differentcausal explanations. that is, even if diseases are natural kinds, thesuperordinate category of disease may not be. not just any sort ofstory about the causes of abnormal behavior will do, and it isdifficult to reach a satisfactory specification of the sorts of causesthat common sense might recognize. we also distinguish, based on ourcommon sense understanding of human biology, between pathological andnon-pathological versions of the same outward phenomena. because agingis normal we acknowledge that an elderly person will differ from ayoung adult, so our assumptions about normality are sensitive tobackground conditions. but when aging is abnormal, we call it adisease. hutchinson-gilford progeria syndrome, for instance, causeschildren to undergo all the stages of human aging at a bizarrelyaccelerated rate. they nearly always die by seventeen, far gone insenescence. even though we don't know much about it, we think ofhutchinson-gilford as a disease not just because we don't like beingold but because we think it is different from getting old in a waythat must be caused by some underlying pathology. the concept ofdisease necessarily requires, just as objectivism insists, that acondition have a causal history involving abnormal biologicalsystems. so let's turn to objectivism, and see whether it should be aconservative or revisionist position.4. objectivism4.1. forms of objectivismwhen we have decided that someone's biological systems do not functionproperly, we still face the question, how should we think about thatperson's condition? objectivists usually admit that there is more tothe concept of disease than biological malfunction even if they thinkthat biological malfunction is a necessary condition for disease. thisinvolves the two-stage picture (murphy 2006, ch 2) which inverts theconstructivist picture of our practice. an objectivist who buys thetwo stage picture thinks that, first, we agree on the biological factsabout malfunction. at the second stage we make the normative judgmentthat the person with the malfunction is suffering in some way. (thisis the order of conceptual priority, not the chronological sequence inwhich judgments are made.) spitzer and endicott (1978, 18) forexample, say that disease categories are calls toaction; assertions that something has gone wrong within aperson's body in a way that produces consequences we think we need toremedy (see also papineau 1994).normative considerations, on this account, inform our judgments aboutdisease but do not have the conceptual priority accorded them byconstructivists. we make judgments that someone is suffering in wayswe associate with inner malfunction. we also see people who aresuffering but who we don't think are ill or injured, because we donot regard their bodily dysfunction as symptoms of disease:vaccination, surgical incisions, ear-piercing or childbirth areexamples. or imagine a skin condition that in some cultures causes thesufferer to be worshiped as a god, or become a sought-after sexualpartner. the two-stage picture is designed to distinguish between thephysical abnormality and the difference it makes to the life of theperson who has it. the idea is that whether someone's body is notfunctioning correctly is a separate question from whether it is bad tobe like that.the second stage, the question about whether life is worsened by amalfunction, is omitted by simple objectivism. simple objectivists saythat all there is to disease is the failure of someone's physiology(or psychology) to work normally. the view has few adherents, but asnoted above, szasz (1987) uses simple objectivism about disease tojustify his claims that mental disorder is a myth.4.2. specifying causeswe have arrived at a generic objectivism that says judgments ofillness are sensitive to causal antecedents of the right sort, as wellas to value judgments about the effects of those causes. what are theright causal antecedents? culver and gert's (1982) requirement thatthe antecedents be a nondistinct sustaining cause is abiologically noncommittal criterion. culver and gert analyze theconcept of a malady, which involves suffering evils, or increased riskof evil, due to a condition not sustained by somethingdistinct from oneself (1982, 72). the cause can be physicalor mental, (p.87), provided it is a sustaining cause that is notdistinct from the sufferer (p.88). a wrestler's hammerlock, becauseits effects come and go with the presence or absence of the causeitself, is an example of a sustaining cause. but because the wrestleris a distinct entity from the sufferer, someone in a hammerlock doesnot have a malady. if the cause is inside the body it is nondistinctjust in case it is difficult to remove (e.g. a surgical implement leftin the body) or it is biologically integrated in the body (e.g. aretrovirus). this is an attractively simple solution but it is tooinclusive. culver and gert (p.71) say that loss of freedom,opportunity or pleasure count as evils. but if that is so, then blackcitizens of south africa and mississippi used to suffer from maladies,since they were unfree, unhappy and oppressed. and they suffered theseevils because of black skin, which was a nondistinct sustaining aspectof their nature. but it wasn't a disease.this counterexample is instructive however, since there are two waysof amending the proposal in the light of it. first, perhaps theprinciple of nondistinct sustaining causes fails to capture ourintuitions about causes of disease. a second possibility is that theprinciple is a good causal condition, but that the account of evils istoo broad, and needs to be restricted to a more intuitively medicalset of evils, rather than the broader class of impediments towell-being. the section on health will go over the terrain that'srelevant for the second option; the current discussion is about thecausal condition. boorse (1975, 1976, 1977, 1997) and his followershave opted for a more restrictive view of the causes of disease. theycontend that disease necessarily involves biologicalmalfunction. boorse distinguished disease fromillness. the former is the failure to conform to thespecies-typical design of humans, and the latter is amatter of judgments that a disease is undesirable, entitles one tospecial treatment, or excuses bad behavior. an account of malfunctionmust be parasitic on a theory of function. boorse thinks a function isa species-typical contribution to survival andreproduction (1976, 6263). disease is failure to functionaccording to a species design that is a product of natural selection(1977, 550; 1997, 32). boorse understands this as functioningmore than a certain distance below the population mean(1977, 559) for the relevant set of humans. (since not all membersof a species have the same design in every respect, we need to specifyreference classes according to biologically relevant subgroups.) thiscutoff point, he thinks, can only be specified as a matter ofconvention, but this conventional element does not threaten theobjectivity of diagnoses. boorse's position has been very influential. in psychiatry, forinstance, wakefield (1992, 1997a, 1997b), follows boorse (1976) inassuming that humans have a species-typical design produced by naturalselection, and adds the rider that individual functions within theoverall system are to be analysed in terms of natural selectiontoo. wakefield applies the picture to both mental and physicalillness: first, we judge that a psychological mechanism is notperforming the function for which natural selection designed it;second, we judge that the malfunction is harmful. an appeal to naturalfunction, by adding extra commitments to the idea of a cause ofillness, rules out skin pigment as a cause of evil. but the boorsianview also faces difficulties.cooper (2002, 265) suggests that boorse's straightforward appeal todysfunction must be qualified in light of some apparentcounterexamples. a woman taking contraceptive pills, for example, maybe interfering with typical functioning, but ingestingcontraceptives is not a disease. (boorse would have to call it aself-inflicted disease that does not make the woman ill.) cooper alsoraises the problem of individuals with chronic conditions that arecontrolled by drugs. she argues that these are cases of diseasedsubjects who nonetheless function normally and suggests that theanalysis must be amended to talk of a disposition to malfunction. but,as cooper sees, the big problem faced by boorsian accounts is that ofcoming up with an acceptable conception of normal function in the firstplace. 4.3 functionsthe boorsian analysis is of a commonsense concept of disease whichbottoms out in a notion of malfunction as the cause of illness. theview is that conceptual analysis determines the empirical commitmentsof our disease concepts and then hands over to the biomedical sciencesthe problem of biological finding functions and malfunctions. thereare three problems with this general project, which affect differentscholars in different ways. first, wakefield's stress on adistinctively evolutionary account of function is unattractive, sincethe biomedical sciences employ a different conception offunction. second, a reliance on scientifically, functionaldecomposition as the ultimate justification of judgments of health anddisease requires a revisionist, rather than a conservative,account. third, it may not always be possible to settle contestedcases by an appeal to a notion of normal human nature, because thatnotion is itself contested.first, why suppose that the relevant concept of function is anadaptive one, and that dysfunction is a failure of a biological systemto fulfill its adaptive function? wakefield's harmful dysfunctionanalysis has been developed with little attempt to argue that medicinedoes in fact use an evolutionary, teleological account of function. inopposition, schaffner (1993) has argued very convincingly thatalthough medicine might use teleological talk in its attempts todevelop a mechanistic picture of how humans work, the teleology isjust heuristic. it can be completely dispensed with when themechanistic explanation of a given organ or process iscomplete. schaffner argues that as we learn more about the causal rolea structure plays in the overall functioning of the organism, the needfor teleological talk of any kind drops out and is superseded by thevocabulary of mechanistic explanation, and that evolutionaryfunctional ascriptions are merely heuristic; they focus our attentionon entities that satisfy the secondary [i.e. mechanistic] senseof function and that it is important for us to know more about(1993, 390).in effect, schaffner is arguing that the biomedical sciences employ acausal, rather than a teleological, concept of function. this is inthe spirit of cummins's (1975) analysis of function as the causalcontribution a structure makes to the overall operation of the systemthat includes it. cummins's concept of function is not a historical orevolutionary concept. according to cummins, a component may have afunction even it was not designed or selected for and, therefore,parts with no selection history can be ascribed a function. boorseand his followers have tied disease conceptually to an evolutionaryconcept of function as a naturally selected capacity. it is doubtfulif this connection can be found in either science or common senseabout disease. perhaps in some areas of biology functional ascriptionis indeed teleological. however, most theorists who have attended tobiomedical contexts agree with schaffner that the function of an organor structure can be understood without thinking of it as anadaptation. medical understanding requires that functional structurescan be identified and analyzed in terms of their contribution to theoverall maintenance of the organism as a living system. explanation inmedicine takes a model of the normal realization of a biologicalprocess and uses the model to show how abnormalities stem from thefailure of normal relations to apply between components of themodel. this requires a non-historical function concept, one that is athome in casual-mechanistic, rather than evolutionary, explanation.functional attributions in medicine appear to get their sense from therole they play in showing how the overall performance of a biologicalsystem depends on the contributions of its component systems, withoutfurther tying the systems to an overall goal. the boorsian approachfaces problems in specifying such an overall goal and showing howfunctions contribute to it. first, it is very difficult to assess therelevant evidence that a given biological systems is as inwakefield's treatment the product of natural selection (davies2001, chapter 5). since many ailments do not prevent one from livingand having children, it is even harder to show that a disease isnecessarily the product of a malfunction that lowers fitness or as in boorse interferes with survival andreproduction. a second problem for wakefield is that if you regardevolutionary dysfunction as partly constitutive of disease then if anillness depends on structures that have no evolved function, it cannotreally be an illness. a biological structure might be a spandrel or aby-product, or have some other non-selective history. such a structurecannot malfunction in wakefield's sense, and so it cannot bediseased.objections to an evolutionary notion of medical malfunction do notshow that there is anything wrong with the general idea of basingjudgments of health and disease on a scientifically establishedpicture of the normal functional decomposition of humanbeings. however, on this account, it becomes harder to retain theconservative project that looks for the natural phenomena that fallunder, and are therefore constrained by, our folk concepts of healthand disease. both sides of kitcher's objectivist/constructivist divideusually assume that there is a lay concept of disorder that shouldconstrain the scientific understanding of what is or is not a medicaldisorder. wakefield, for instance, thinks some psychiatric diagnosesflout our intuitions by attributing disorder on the basis of behavioralone without looking for malfunctioning mental mechanisms (1997a). heappeals to intuitions to derive necessary and sufficient conditionsfor the folk concept of mental disorder, and assumes that scienceshould search for the psychological processes that fit the conceptthus defined. but it is one thing to take intuitions as a startingpoint, and another to say that they are hegemonic. boorse, too,adduces everyday linguistic usage and commonsense intuitions asevidence, even though he claims to be discussing the clinical conceptsof health and disease. a revisionist can say that a condition we currently disvalue but donot regard as a disease may turn out to involve malfunction and henceto be a disease, whatever our intuitions say. conversely, we may thinksomething is a disease but we might be wrong, just as we were wrongabout drapetomania or masturbation, which do not causally depend onany biological malfunction. conservatives resist thispossibility. wakefield claims that we have intuitions about humannature that make it obvious from surface featureswhether underlying mechanisms are functional or dysfunctional(wakefield 1997b, 256). but it is an empirical issue whether one'sphysiology or psychology is functioning properly, not a conceptual oneto be decided from the armchair.once we hand over the task of uncovering malfunction to the scienceswe can no longer make common sense the ultimate arbiter, unless wewish to explicitly import, into the concept of disease, considerationsderived from folk theories of what normal human nature amounts to.the normative and scientific components of the analysis are intension. the analysis of disease as depending on malfunctioningbiological components requires a functional decomposition of humanbiology. if that decomposition is to be independent of what we thinkpeople should be like, it should not be regulated by common sensetheories of human nature, but discovered by science. we must be ableto ascertain, within acceptable limits of variation, the biologicalstandards that nature has imposed on humans. the goal of finding outhow a biological system works is fixed by our interests in health andwell-being, but the objectivist assumption is that the goal is met bydiscovering empirical facts about human biology, not our own,culturally defined, norms. so, we diagnose someone as suffering frommesenteric adenitis not just because they are in discomfort due tofever, abdominal pain and diarrhea, but because the lower rightquadrant of the mesenteric lymphatic system displays abnormalinflammation. this thickening of the nodes is not just the objectivecause of the discomfort, it is an objective failure of the lymphaticsystem to make its normal contribution to the overall system. for theobjectivist program to work, the biological roles of human organs mustbe natural facts just as empirically discoverable as the atomicweights of chemical elements. that may result in the overturning ofcommon sense.this raises a further issue. it is widely believed that functionconcepts are intrinsically normative, since they areteleological. therefore, the objection continues, claims about naturalfunctional and malfunction introduce normative considerations into thefoundations of medicine, which are supposed to be purelyscientific.the view that the correct functional decomposition of humans can bediscovered in nature is very strong. it's the view that naturalfunctional standards for human nature exist independently of whatpeople think. the idea is that in cases where we can ascribe functionto a physiological mechanism the standards of good performance aresupplied by nature and not by human values. if that can be done, thenmalfunction can be understood as a failure of the system to functionas it is naturally supposed to. whether or not this should be seen asnormative, it is not the socially relative normativity appealed to byconstructivists. the crucial point is that in the life sciences, somebiological system can fail to behave as a theory predicts withoutimpugning the prediction: we can say that the system ismalfunctioning. this contrasts with other sciences, in which, if asystem fails to behave as predicted, the fault lies with the science,not the system.but where is an account of malfunction to be found? supporters of aselectionist account of function advertise the ease with which anaccount of malfunction follows from the theory as one of itsvirtues. their idea is that we can say when a system is malfunctioningby observing that it is not carrying out the job which naturalselection designed it to perform. in contrast, it is widely believedthat systemic accounts of function cannot deal with malfunction atall. the argument goes that what a system is taken to do is relativeto our explanatory interests, and that a putative malfunction can justbe understood as a contribution to a different property of thesystem. davies (2001) argues that the first of these claims can bedefeated by restricting functional ascriptions to hierarchicallyorganized systems in which lower level capacities realize upper levelones. that gives us a characterization of function independent of ourexplanatory interests.godfrey-smith (1993) argues that systemic concepts of function dopermit attributions of malfunction. he argues that a token componentin a system is malfunctioning when it cannot play the role that letsother tokens of the same type feature in the explanation of the largersystem. davies (2003, 212) denies this. he says that functionaltypes are defined in terms of what they can do and that if a componentcannot carry out its normal contribution to the overall system then itceases to be a member of a type. however, davies' objection appears tofail, at least in medical contexts, if we can identify componentsapart from their functional roles. suppose we can identify biologicalcomponents in terms of their anatomical position and relationships toother organs. if so, we can say that an organ in the positioncharacteristic of its type remains a member of that type even thoughit has lost some capacity characteristic of that type, and hence ismalfunctioning. reasoning like this permits doctors to identify organsas normal or abnormal during autopsies, even though every system in acorpse no longer possesses its normal function in davies's sense.this leaves unaddressed the issue of how we determine what normalfunction is. wachbroit (1994) argues that when we say that an organis normal, we employ a biomedical concept of normality that is anidealized description of a component of a biological system in anunperturbed state that may never be attained in actual systems. boorse(1977, 1997) insists that the notion of normality in biomedicalconcepts is statistical how things usually are in a referenceclass, but this view faces the problem of specifying the referenceclasses in an informative way. but given the amount of variationwithin a species, it will always be hard to find reference classeswhich share a design. as ereshefsky (forthcoming) puts it, boorseassumes that statistical normality coincides with the kind ofnormality that medicine cares about, but this looks wrong. wachbroit(1994, 588) argues convincingly that the role of normality inphysiology is like the role that pure states or ideal entities play inphysical theories.4.4. normality and variationstatistically, a textbook heart, for example, may be very rareindeed. but it is the account of the organ that gets into thephysiology textbook. the textbook tells you what a healthy organ islike by reference to an abstractionan idealized organ. thisconcept of normality is not justified by appeal to a conceptualanalysis that aims to capture intuitions about what's normal. it drawsall its authority from its predictive and explanatory utility: againstthe background of assuming normal heart function, for example, weaccount for variation in actual hearts (a particular rhythm, say), byciting the textbook rhythmic pattern (which may be very unusualstatistically) and identifying other patterns as arrhythmic. the pointof textbook depictions of human physiology is to identify an idealsystem that enables us to answer what if things had been differentquestions (woodward 2003, murphy 2006). the role of anidealization, in this system, is to let us classify real systemsaccording to their departure from the ideal. so normal humanbiological nature, in this sense, is an idealization designed to letus impose order on variation.variation in biological traits is ubiquitous, and so establishingwhether a mechanism is functioning normally is difficult: nonetheless,biologists do it all the time. but not all diagnoses can be tied to abreak between normal and abnormal functioning of an underlyingmechanism, such as a failure of the kidneys to conserveelectrolytes. nor can we always discover some other abnormality, suchas the elevated levels of helicobacter pylori bacteria that have beenfound to be causally implicated in stomach ulcers (discussed in detailby thagard 1999). some conditions involve cutting between normal andpathological parts of a continuous variation, even in the absence ofclear underlying malfunctions that separate the populations.the more of this we have to do, the more we will have to complicatethe analysis by appeal to risk factors and behavioral difficultiesrather than natural standards of underlying function. and that raisesthe worry that the behavioral factors we cite will reflect contestedconceptions of human flourishing. distinguishing failures to flourishfrom functional abnormalities will always be a special problem forpsychiatry. for example, judgments of irrationality are central tomany psychiatric diagnoses, and our standards of rational thoughtreflect not biological findings but standards derived from normativereflection. the possibility of psychiatric explanation employing themethods and models of physical medicine, then, depends on how much ofour psychology is like the visual systemi.e. decomposable intostructures to which we can ascribe a natural function (murphy2006). within medicine more generally, the prospects for a generalobjectivism about disease depend on our ability to understand humanbiology as a set of structures whose functions we can discoverempirically, and our capacity to understand disease causally as theproduct of failures of those structures to perform their naturalfunctions.5. health5.1 health and biologyas noted above, conceptions of health, like conceptions of disease,tend to go beyond the simple condition that one is biologically insome state. in the case of health, one view is that a healthyindividual is just someone whose biology works as our theories say itshould. this is the counterpart, in theories of health, to simpleobjectivism about disease. as with disease, however, most scholars whowrite about health and add further conditions having to do withquality of life. on this view, we need a threefold distinction betweendisease, normality and health, where health involves some propertiesof a person's life that enable us to evaluate how well it is going forthem. carel (2007, 2008), for example, thinks that the important thing abouthealth is one's lived experience of one's own body, and in particular,that one should not feel estranged or alienated from one's body. carelargues that health should be understood phenomenologically as theexperience of being at home in one's lived body, rather than merelythe normal functioning of the body seen as a biological unit.from the objectivist perspective, one problem with this proposal isthat it ignores that one can feel perfectly at ease with one's livedbody even if one harbors, unaware, a diseased system. indeed, carelargues that someone who is ill can be, in her sense, healthy, if theyare adapted to their bodily predicament; from her perspective,objections like the one just mentioned miss the point, since theyprivilege a biological perspective rather than a phenomenologicalone. her project is avowedly revisionist: she wishes to replaceexisting concepts of health with views that aim to capture theexperience of being healthy (or unwell). it may well be thatperspectives like carel's are neglected in contemporary medicine, andespecially important in disability studies. however, it does notfollow that the concepts of health and disease, rather than aspects ofour practices that employ those concepts, should be reformed along thelines she suggests.carel's stress on experience is directly challenged by views likegadamer's. he insists (1996, 113) that it is absurd to ask someoneif they feel healthy, since health is not a condition that oneintrospectively feels in oneself. rather, it is a condition of beinginvolved, of being in the world, of being together with one's fellowhuman beings, of active and rewarding engagement in one's everydaytasks. gadamer's healthy person is someone is in harmony with thesocial and natural environment, and disease is a disturbance of thisharmony.5.2 embedded instrumentalismgadamer's view is reminiscent of what richman (2003) callsembedded instrumentalist theories, which claim thathealth is indexed to goals: how healthy you are depend on how well youcan fulfill your goals. such theories are very popular. nordenfelt(1995) considered two versions of this approach. one version definesthe goals relevant to health as needs, which are understood as havinga biological basis. another view defines goals in terms of theambitions and desires of the individual. nordenfelt (1995, 90)argues that a healthy person is one who can satisfy her vitalgoals, which are those that are necessary and sufficient forher to be minimally happy.embedded instrumentalist theories of health have an obviousappeal. once we argue that health involves judgments about how well aperson's life is going, we need a way to evaluate that, and animmediately attractive idea is that someone's life goes well if theycan achieve their ambitions or satisfy their goals. an apparentdifficulty, however, is that much the same terrain is covered bytheories of well-being, and while people think that being healthy isimportant to their well-being (eid and larsen 2007), they do notidentify the two. rather, they think of health as a component ofwell-being.some embedded instrumentalist theories, though, appear to be in dangerof defining health in such a way that it is synonymous withwell-being. richman (2003), for example, develops his view, (therichman-budson view) to deal with objections thatnordenfelt raises against goal-based views, such as the worry thatsomeone with very low ambitions will count as healthy just because sheis easily satisfied. richman (2003, 5657) supposes that someone ishealthy if she can strive for a consistent set of goals that would bechosen by an idealized version of herself if she were fully aware ofher objectified subjective interest (p.45). that is,they are the goals she would choose if she had complete knowledge ofherself and her environment and perfect rationality.in this case it seems that a theory of health is in danger of becominga general theory of well-being, and richman does not discuss therelation between the two. a further complication is the relationshipbetween medical interventions designed to cure diseases, and othermedical interventions which are enhancement technologies(elliott 2003). the line between enhancement and therapy is very hardto draw: harris (2007, 21) for example, uses the example ofvaccination, which is both a therapeutic protection against infectionand an enhancement of our natural immune system. perhaps, too, many ofus would benefit from a boost to our powers of concentration, or alift in our mood, which pharmaceuticals might supply. but neurologicalenhancements, unlike vaccines, can help us to meet our goals withoutguarding against disease. perhaps what is needed is a weaker view ofthe relation between health and goal-directedness, such as thatoffered by whitbeck (1981, 620). whitbeck defines health in termsof the psychophysiological capacities of an individual that supporther goals, projects and aspirations in a wide variety ofsituations. this view loosens the tight richman-budsonconnection between health and goal-directed action, and suggests aview on which we can see biological capacities as at the core ofhealth in so far as they help people's lives to go better.6. conclusionsobjectivism and constructivism have been distinguished for analyticpurposes in this essay but they are not always easy to tell apart inpractice. the difficulty comes from the fact that there is widespreadagreement that our thinking about disease pays attention to both humanvalues and biological phenomena, and it is not always easy to tell howa theorist explains the interactions of these factors, nor whether agiven analysis is descriptive or prescriptive. for an objectivist therelevant biological processes are departures from good humanfunctioning, to be determined by the relevant science. thesebiological problems result in what we judge to be difficulties inliving. for a constructivist, it is the problems people face in theirlives that take priority. their biological underpinnings are ones wecount as abnormal because we have judged them to be both relevant tothe conditions we disvalue and also the subject matter of a specific,medical, class of interventions, therapies and other practices. theobstacle to a successful development of objectivism is the problem ofestablishing a satisfactory, science-based, distinction between normaland abnormal human functioning. overcoming this difficulty willrequire a closer engagement by theorists of disease with the relevantdebates in the philosophy of biology.for constructivists, the big problem is to say why we judge of somethings that they are symptoms of disease whereas other human phenomenaare taken as evidence that someone is criminal or ugly or possessed bydemons or something else we do not admire. it is not generally truethat we think that if someone's life goes badly it is because he orshe is unhealthy, so constructivists owe us an account of what makes acertain class of judgments distinctively medicalized. many theoristshave traced the changes in medicalization over time, but asatisfactory constructivist concept of disease requires an analysis ofhow medical thinking comes to play a role in human societies to beginwith.bibliographybloomfield, p., 2001. moral reality, new york: oxforduniversity press.broome, m., 2006. taxonomy and ontology in psychiatry: asurvey of recent
