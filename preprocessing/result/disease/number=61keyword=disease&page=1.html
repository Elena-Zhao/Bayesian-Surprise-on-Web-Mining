celiac disease? celiac disease, also known as gluten intolerance, is a genetic disorder that affects at least 1 in 133 americans. symptoms of celiac disease can range from the classic features, such as diarrhea, weight loss, and malnutrition, to latent symptoms such as isolated nutrient deficiencies but no gastrointestinal symptoms. the disease mostly affects people of european (especially northern european) descent, but recent studies show that it also affects hispanic, black and asian populations as well. those affected suffer damage to the villi (shortening and villous flattening) in the lamina propria and crypt regions of their intestines when they eat specific food-grain antigens (toxic amino acid sequences) that are found in wheat, rye, and barley. oats have traditionally been considered to be toxic to celiacs, but recent scientific studies have shown otherwise. this research is ongoing, however, and it may be too early to draw solid conclusions. read more celiac disease
