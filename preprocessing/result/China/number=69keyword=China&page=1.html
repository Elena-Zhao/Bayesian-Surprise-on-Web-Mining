this data china’s economic freedom score is 52.5, making its economy the 137th freest in the 2014 index. its overall score is 0.6 point higher than last year, with modest improvements in investment freedom, business freedom, and monetary freedom outweighing declines in freedom from corruption, labor freedom, and the management of government spending. china is ranked 29th out of 42 countries in the asia–pacific region, and its overall score continues to be lower than the global and regional averages.over the 20-year history of the index, china’s economic freedom has been almost unchanged, stuck near the lower boundary of the “mostly unfree” category. however, the overall stagnation masks major changes in certain categories of economic freedom: trade freedom has improved by over 50 points, while scores for investment freedom, financial freedom, property rights, and the control of government spending have all suffered double-digit declines. although the boost in trade freedom has undoubtedly helped spur china’s high overall growth rates, the deterioration in other categories indicates that major economic reforms are still needed to create a more balanced and sustainable economy.the lack of political will to undertake more fundamental restructuring of the economy has led to continued overreliance on public investment. the communist party’s ultimate authority throughout the economic system undermines the rule of law, and institutionalized cronyism remains pervasive. read more about china economy. close background china’s communist party maintains tight control of speech, religion, and assembly. there is some hope for economic reform from the new government led by communist party general secretary xi jinping, but meaningful political reform is highly unlikely. environmental degradation and an aging society fuel popular discontent. china liberalized parts of its economy starting in the late 1970s and again in the early 1990s and achieved impressive gdp growth in part through greater integration into the world trading and financial systems. the size of its industrial and manufacturing sector now rivals that of the united states, though china lags far behind in other areas. rule of lawview methodology property rights 20.0 create a graph using this measurement freedom from corruption 35.0 create a graph using this measurement many anti-corruption whistleblowers face physical violence or intimidation from those they expose and enjoy little protection from the police or the internal disciplinary investigators of the ruling
