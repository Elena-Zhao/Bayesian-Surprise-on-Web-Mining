first known dynasty, xia. the first major era in its history is imperial china, which began with the qin state in 221 bc, with the first emperor qin shi huang. the qin dynasty lasted only fifteen years until the emperor's death. but during his short reign, emperor qin made many lasting changes to china, including standardizing the language, measurements, and currency.the qin dynasty was followed by the han dynasty, which lasted from 206 bc to 220 ad. this dynasty was a period of expansion, with military campaigns conquering parts of korea, vietnam, mongolia, and central asia. during this period the silk road was established. with the collapse of the han dynasty, china became divided into the three kingdoms.in 580 ad, china was reunited under the short-lived sui dynasty, followed by the tang and song dynasties. during these dynasties, chinese culture thrived. during this period in the tenth and eleventh centuries, with the advancements in rice cultivation, china saw food

were fought against britain and then france joined in during the second. the first opium war was from 1839 to 1842, and the second lasted from 1856 to 1860. while these wars focused on the opium trade, they were largely about the issue of european imperialism.one result was the taiping rebellion, one of the bloodiest civil wars in history, with around 20 million lives lost. the war started in 1851 and ended in 1862, and was won by the qing forces, but followed by several other rebellions. the chinese diaspora began in the nineteenth century, motivated by the famine of 1876 to 1879, which

when he tried to proclaim himself emperor of china in 1915, he was forced to reestablish the republic. after his death, china split into regional governments, and was reunified in the 1920s by chiang kai-shek, in what was called the northern expedition. political divisions persisted, and communists fought for control from the weakened republic of china, leading to the chinese civil war - the third

zedong. the people's republic of china maintains that they control taiwan, while the republic of china still claims mainland china. however, the people's republic of china took the republic of china's
