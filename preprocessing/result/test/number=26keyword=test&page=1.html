sat test, also known as the sat reasoning test, is used in the application process to colleges and universities in the united states. the test measures critical thinking skills and the ability to analyze and solve problems, and is often thought of as a measure of future college success. the sat test is administered by the educational testing service (ets) at various locations across the country, and it is developed, published, and scored by the college board.the sat test is given seven times a year in the united states. specific test dates and test locations can be found online on the college board's website. there are two ways to register for the sat test, online or by mail. online registration is completed on the website of the college board. in order to register by mail, one needs a copy of the sat registration booklet. this booklet can be obtained from a high school counselor, and it contains the registration form and envelope, as well as registration instructions. all fees must be paid when registering, whether online or by mail, and fee information can be found online or in the sat registration booklet.the sat test consists of four sections; critical reading, mathematics, writing, and a variable or equating section. the essay part of the writing section is always first on the test, and the multiple choice part of the writing section is always last on the test. the other sections can vary in their test placement. the critical reading section of the sat test consists of two 25 minute sections and one 20 minute section. all of the test items in this section are multiple choice questions that pertain to either short reading or long reading passages. these questions test reading comprehension, sentence completion, sentence level reading, and paragraph length critical reading.the mathematics section of the sat test consists of two 25 minute sections and one 20 minute section. the test questions in this section are either multiple choice or student produced response (grid-in) questions. subjects tested in this section include number and operations, algebra and functions, geometry, statistics, probability, and data analysis. the writing section of the sat test contains a 35 minute multiple choice section and a 25 minute essay section. the multiple choice questions test grammar, usage, and word choice through improving sentences, paragraphs, and the identification of sentence errors. the essay question deals with the development of a point of view on an issue. the variable or equating section of the sat test is an unscored section of the test, and it is used to aid in the development of future sat test questions and to compare the difficulty levels of different test versions. the variable section can be either a critical reading, mathematics, or writing section, and test takers are given 25 minutes to complete the section.test directorysat test / sat test essay / sat test vocabulary / mysatreview.com /sat subject testssat test prep / sat exam / sat scores / sat testing / paying for college / sat video review offered by the mometrix academyeach section of the sat test first is given a raw score. for the critical reading section, the mathematics section, and the multiple choice part of the writing section, the raw score is computed in the following manner. one point is given to each correct answer, and one quarter of a point is subtracted for each incorrect multiple choice answer. zero points are given to incorrect student produced responses in the mathematics section. the raw scores are then converted to scaled scores, which take into account varying degrees of difficulty on different test versions. for the mathematics and critical reading sections, scaled scores range from 200 (low) to 800 (high). for the multiple choice portion of the writing section, scaled sub-scores range from 20 (low) to 80 (high). for the essay portion of the writing section, two trained readers each score the essay holistically on a scale of one (low) to six (high). this gives a total scaled sub-score that can range from two (low) to 12 (high). for the writing section of the test, the scaled sub-scores for both the multiple choice and the essay are then combined to give an overall scaled score for the writing section, ranging from 200 (low) to 800 (high). we have provided the sat test resources and the
