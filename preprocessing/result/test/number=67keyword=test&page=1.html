[1]method 3 of 4: testing soil ph using vinegar and baking soil ph step 11 version 4.360p.mp41take a cup of soil from your garden. put a few spoonfuls of it into two separate soil ph step 12 version 4.360p.mp42add vinegar to one container. if it fizzes, it means your soil is alkaline. in that case, you do not need to proceed to the next soil ph step 13 version 4.360p.mp43add water to the other container of soil. you want enough that it becomes very wet and muddy. pour baking soda into this cup; if it fizzes, it means your soil is soil ph step 14 version 4.360p.mp44check both soil samples again. if neither sample began fizzing, it means you probably have a neutral ph of 7. this is good, as this is the ph most plants need to grow in. [2]method 4 of 4: changing your soil soil ph step 15 version 2.360p.mp41make your soil less acidic. if your soil ph tested below 7, add lime or wood ash to the soil. both are available at local gardening soil ph step 16 version 2.360p.mp42make your soil less alkaline. if your soil ph tested above 7, add organic matter such as pine needles, peat moss, or decomposed tree soil ph step 17 version 2.360p.mp43change your soil ph to suit specific plants. for example, add wood ash to a certain area of your garden to endorse the growth of hydrangeas which prefer more alkaline soil. the ph of your soil does not need to be uniform your entire garden over; feel free to alter it to support different plants.
