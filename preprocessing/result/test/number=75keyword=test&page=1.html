"why," you ask? because we want profile pages to have freedom of customization, but also to have some consistency. this way, when anyone visits a deviant, they know they can always find the art in the top left, and personal info in the top right. don't forget, restraints can bring out the creativity in you! now go forth and astound us all with your devious profiles! ok join nowadvertise here little girl big enhancement(s) 7 comments newest deviations mako sketch by test-03 commentsyukiko amagi still zapped by test-02 commentscute omiyo by test-02 commentsjade rose exchange by test-03 comments browse gallery random favourites may day, may day by riftwalker89 commentsprier by yellb45 commentsfather yugi and mother anzu by pgirls48 commentsuninhabited planet survive by lizmun36 commentsbrowse favourites watchers supershardysaburokodaistockings300mariobros085dualnickel45sbelover69werewolfgirl-90reyzonxglennlarkinsilverfan1999reconguistachryslerme412manssj3vegettoantoniorenteriaepicluigimariomelonbloblewa282nicoyagamitgcannonlukmistall watchers activity still not doing requests, also problem has occured by test-0, apr 14, 2014, 12:00:22 am journals / personal still not doing requests.on to other news, the hard drive with all my stuff on it failed. and all the backups of all those files are also dead. and in those files was every possible thing i have ever drawn, original psds and so on. there's a small chance i can get them back, but for the moment i have none of my files anymore. i already have stuff reinstalled and running on another hard drive (this one), including luckily all my drawing tools which were on a separate drive, so i can draw. just... i don't have anything else.if the recovery fails down the road, then that's basically it for all my originals. this da will be the last place almost everything i've drawn remains.not going to stop drawing btw, even though i haven't done a lot of it in the last while and lost every original, doesn't mean i won't keep moving forward. no matter how slowly that might be. so, uh... i dunno, have you read the questions in test-0.deviantart.com/art/unde and given answers and linked your fav? because suddenly that seems a bit more important now, seeing as i'll have to borrow my own image gallery for any redraws and such in the future and seeing people link to their favs would make me a bit more cheerful. 9 comments mood: i have to pee still not doing requests, also problem has occured april 14 9 comments no favourites more journal entries adcast - ads from the community comments add a comment: preview submit comment load all images kaiserdeathiv featured by owner aug 24, 2014 i dont think that you do requests currently right? reply test-0 featured by owner aug 24, 2014 correct, requests and such still closed. reply turtwigchampion featured by owner aug 4, 2014 is their any chance we might could see future lightning round games? reply test-0 featured by owner aug 4, 2014 extreme future maybe, recent future not likely. would require the time and ability i currently lack to put into running a game. also i'd have to remake all the rules and functions and everything since that was on my hd that died. reply turtwigchampion featured by owner aug 4, 2014 oh yeah. didn't get anything back huh? reply test-0 featured by owner aug 4, 2014 the requirement to get it working again would be to use parts from an identical hd and it's not a cheap item to destroy just for information, so for the moment i just have to sit on it and wait it out. reply (1 reply) shiney103 featured by owner jun 2, 2014 you know, i've commented before on your work, but i think i missed what really set you apart from others before. i searched deviantart by the name of a small little idea you had way back when, deciding to look for anything similar.surprisingly, your works were the only ones that even showed up, even under broader search terms, it seems as far as devantart is concerned, you're the only one who even has these ideas.it's partly the interesting idea, the concept that no one else would think of, brought forward. while your art style is changing and growing with you, it doesn't need to be precise, doing it's job of capturing the idea before us. and the descriptions, while i tend to prefer more in-depth stories, always open the door to invite others to "fill in the blanks" as it were, giving enough groundwork that people would be able to do so.the ideas are unique.the art matches them and brings them forward in a way words sometimes can't.the descriptions are enough to lay a groundwork, and invite others to run wild with these ideas. reply test-0 featured by owner jun 3, 2014 neat, it mirrors why i started drawing stuff in the first place, to see stuff that no one else would do. i do enough for the idea to come out and then let people decide for themselves where it goes from there. it's actually why i don't do nude stuff much anymore. while it's not really my thing either, it's also because i don't like just handing out the full package. it's like giving someone a present that isn't wrapped up, you gotta let them have the fun of taking the wrapping off.thanks for this by the way, it does help a lot in pointing me in the right directions for where i was going before i crashed my trains of thought. reply shiney103 featured by owner jun 4, 2014 no problem, the full realization didn't hit me until fairly recently, and just wanted to share it. while i totally get the non-nude thing, i want to say that sometimes it depends on the idea as well. (not to over advocate the nudity, i don't think any of those are actually in my favorites.)that said, i'd have to say is sometimes my complaint is that there's so little. i'd actually love to see where you'd personally take ideas at times, but i get that that wasn't really what those were about. reply test-0 featured by owner jun 10, 2014 if the idea fits the nudity i would actually add it, but most of the time i prefer to play with the audience and the way stuff casually block the view. i actually just finished drawing an addition to an older image thing i did before and when i got back in to post it and saw your comments again it made me wonder, which ideas did you look for before? reply (3 replies)previous123...80next go to page: go add a comment: preview submit comment 2014 deviantart. all rights reserved about contact developers careers site tour help faq advertise premium membership etiquette privacy policy terms of service copyright policy sta.sh submit sta.sh sta.sh writer deviantart muro submit deviantart hide media preview submit comment add media style skin: change skin upload files
