depression test directions: taking this test for depression is quick and easy. read each question and then select the button for the answer which best fits. then, click the button at the bottom to move to the next question. at the end of the questions, you will receive your score and be told what it means.this test is completely confidential and no data will be collected about you.if you would like to learn more about the test itself, please scroll down below the first question. about the depression testthe test questions and their evaluation are based upon information from mental health america (formerly the national mental health association). this screening tool is not intended to replace a visit to a mental health professional. you can, however, use this information to open a dialogue with your physician about the depression symptoms that you have been experiencing.what to do if you score high on this testif your score indicates that you may be suffering from depression, it is a good idea to see a doctor for a professional evaluation. your personal physician is a good starting place. she can give you a physical to determine if your symptoms are due to a medical illness or any medications that you might be taking. once these factors are ruled out, she can either treat your depression or refer you to a psychiatrist, therapist or counselor for further specialized help.if you have been feeling suicidal, you have several options for immediate help. if you are in danger of hurting yourself, you can contact your local emergency room or 911 for assistance. and, if what you really need is someone to talk you through your feelings, you can either consult s phone directory or 411 to obtain a local crisis number or you can call a national hotline at1-800-784-2433 or 1-800-273-8255.whatever you choose to do, the important thing is that you do seek assistance. depression is a treatable illness. there is no shame in admitting that you need a helping hand.what to do if you score low, but you have doubts about the resultsalthough this depression test can help you get an idea if you are suffering from the symptoms of depression, how you are feeling is the most important thing. if you just don't feel right within yourself, there is no harm in talking with a doctor. it is very common to feel like you are the only one who has ever experienced what you are going through, but you may not be as alone as you think you are. opening up the door to speak with someone about how you are feeling is the first step in getting well. don't allow an arbitrary number on a screening tool to stand in the way of your getting help.what if you've already gotten help, but it's just not working?unfortunately a certain percentage of people do have a difficult time finding a treatment that they will respond to. they may go from one medication to the next, either getting no relief at all, or only partial or temporary relief. but, while this is very discouraging and frustrating, it does not mean that they are without hope. in fact, more and more options are becoming available for these people every day. new medications with different modes of action are being developed by researchers. and, just because a person has tried several different medications in the past, this does not mean that a new one coming down the pipeline won't help him. also, there is a method in existence right now, which, while it may seem like an extreme option to some, it is very effective in quickly lifting severe depression: electroconvulsive therapy (ect). in addition, there are other recently developed treatments which have been quite successful for those with treatment-resistance, including transcranial magnetic stimulation (tms), vagus nerve stimulation (vns) and deep brain stimulation (dbs). these treatments are, of course, a bit more invasive than simply taking a pill every day; but, they often work where other, traditional treatments have failed, giving people who have suffered for years with their depression relief. if nothing else has worked for you then these options are all well worth asking your doctor about before you give up.related articleswakefield depression questionnaireother mental health screening testshow is depression diagnosed?what are the symptoms of depression?what should i do if i think i might be depressed?
