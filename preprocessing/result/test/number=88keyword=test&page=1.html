internet speed test - broadband, dsl bandwidth connection checkfirewall test, web tools and free internet security auditfirewall testanti spaminternet speed testsitemap generatorwhats my ipinternet speed test this internet speed test can be used to help you determine your true bandwidth on any connection, such as broadband, cable, satellite and dsl modems. note: for best results, please make sure you are running the latest version of java.note: if you cant run the speed test or the load it too high (connection refused message) try my facebook speedtest application. if you have any questions, please leave a comment at the bottom of this page.we created our internet speed test to be the most accurate broadband speed test on the internet! in fact, many sites charge for speed tests similar to this one!because this speed test is so popular we have to limit the test to 15 users at a time. although we have a large amount of bandwidth, this speedtest may take up to 30 seconds to complete, so please be patient. think the test on this page was cool, then check out our new broadband speed test! own a website? you can put place the test on your site free of charge, complete with logging options and much more! click on the graphic to your left to give it a spin and learn more!before you start the bandwidth test this test accurately measures bandwidth and serves as a dsl speed test and cable modem speed test to help visitors troubleshoot and locate bandwidth issues. before you start the speed test, please keep in mind that it uses tcp port 8500 and 8600 to 8609 to test packets. what does this mean? if you see a connect time out message, then you need to tell your firewall to allow 76.74.166.239 (thats our server) to communicate with your computer using tcp port 8500.here is an example of the ip security policy on a xp machine:protocol = tcp, source port =8500, destination port = any, source address = 76.74.166.239, source mask = 255.255.255.255, destination address = my ip address, destination mask = 255.255.255.255speed test no graphic?if you still can not run the bandwidth test, download the latest version of java. if this does not work, please let me know and ill work with you on this.you can also try our very popular broadband speed test and / or our speed test which also supports any language in the world!it would be greatly appreciated if you would notify us of any problems with this speed test thank you!bandwidth testing can be complicated!there is a lot more to an internet speed test than meets the eye! when you measure bandwidth, be it dsl speed test, cable modem speed test or any other, you have to consider the devices the packets of data travel through. a speed test also has to consider the technology used to deliver those packets of data and account for variations in speed.to give you the most accurate results, our internet speed test was based on a research paper by liang cheng2 and ivan marsic from the department of electrical and computer engineering at rutgers, the state university of new jersey. the paper explains in detail how to accurately measure digital subscriber line networks and is used by our speed test.in researching broadband speed tests, we also found some very unfriendly user interfaces that left us confused as to the results. we have put great effort into providing an accurate, easy to understand graphical interface that clearly displays the results of the internet speed test.for those of you interested in greater detail, keep reading; otherwise, just click the speed test start button. this speed test uses java and will not work with java disabled.internet speed test definitionsthe following internet speed test terms are useful for understanding the speed test measurement report:qosrepresents the level of consistent download capacity provided by your broadband or dsl provider. the higher qos percentage, the higher the overall quality of the internet connection. high quality plus internet speed provides better connections for voip (voice over ip), citrix and other high traffic applications.= 80.rttthe round trip time (rtt) reports the total time in milliseconds (ms) to send a small data packet in our internet speed test and obtain a reply back. the faster (smaller) the rtt, the better broadband speed youll have.for voice over ip, round trip delays can occur when results exceed 250 msec or 150 msec one way which is also considered the maximum desired one-way latency to achieve high-quality voice.max pausemax pause is the longest pause recorded during the broadband speed test data download. this should be a very small number. if not, it could indicate internet speed congestion or a bad broadband connection.anything less that 100 would be ideal for this broadband speed test. speed test how it worksexisting internet speed tests bandwidth testing techniques are not suitable because link asymmetry and atm traffic shaping in xdsl deployments impact the accuracy of their speed test measurements.speed test techniquesa number of techniques exist for speed test and bandwidth measurement. most of them can be categorized into two groups. one group is a variant of pathchar based on the one-packet model. the disadvantage of this group is heavy overhead in bandwidth consumption. the other is a variant of packet-pair based on the packet-pair model. this group imposes lower overhead compared to the first group.in theory, one- or two-packet techniques and the tailgating technique in internet speed tests and can get good estimation of xdsl link bandwidth. however, the existing tools do not regulate the probe packets so that atm traffic shaper will regulate the probe packets for them by packet delay or packet drop.one possible solution is that to explicitly regulate the probe traffic, but then it is difficult to specify the source rate for speed tests. that is why a stepwise scheme is proposed: in the first step of the bandwidth test, a rough estimate of the bandwidth is obtained and the subsequent probe traffic is regulated according to the estimation. multi-packet technique is used to avoid explicit packet filtering to help accurately measure internet speed.broadband tests traffic shapingour broadband speed test take into account that atm traffic shaping has a goal of regulating the traffic flow as per the parameters describing the negotiated qos to achieve better network efficiency. the basic idea of atm traffic shaping is buffering the packets/cells and controlling, mostly delaying, their entry into the network, thereby ensuring a more constant flow of traffic in the network.dsl speed test application to asymmetric dsl networksthe dsl speed test understands that the asymmetric nature of adsl networks makes it necessary to have different measurements methodologies for upstream and downstream cases. the speed tests are based upon the assumption that the upstream bandwidth is lower than the downstream bandwidth.dsl speed test upstream methodologya fixed number of udp packets of uniform size are sent from the customers computer (client) at a rate slightly higher than the nominal bottleneck bandwidth of the adsl network during our dsl speed test. probing traffic with the slightly higher rate (e.g., less than 10%) is necessary to saturate the pipe for testing. a server process on the bandwidth measurement server, echoes back the packets as they arrive at the server end. the time difference, t, is measured between the arrival of the first packet and the last packet at the client end. during the broadband speed test, the upstream bottleneck link bandwidth, b1, is computed as: b1 = (nxpx8)/t [bps]bandwidth test downstream methodologya traffic generator at the bandwidth speed test measurement server generates a downstream traffic. a receiving process at the client measures the arrival time of the packets. because of the nature of adsl, such that the upstream bandwidth is smaller than the downstream bandwidth, the client does not echo the probe packets back. instead, the client computes the downstream bandwidth to accurately check internet speed.bandwidth speed test stepwise schemethe stepwise scheme consists of at least two steps during the speed test. it can be used for both downstream and upstream bandwidth measurements described in the previous section. the generated traffic should be smooth rather than bursty to avoid excessive atm traffic shaping. the stepwise bandwidth measurement scheme runs several times and reports the maximum measured value as the link bandwidth.during the first bandwidth measurement step, a small number of packets, e.g., 10, are sent sequentially back-to-back from the client to the server. this small number of packets will likely not be affected by atm traffic shaping, as most atm networks are capable of handling such small bursts. the computed result is used in the second step of the speed test as the trial bandwidth of the xdsl link.the subsequent step(s) in our internet speed test assumes that the accurate xdsl bandwidth is close to the trial result obtained from the first step. a larger number of packets than that in the first step are used in the measurement to ensure that the results are convergent and in the end consistent. had it not been for the first step that approximately determined the bandwidth, the sustained higher-than-provisioned traffic would result in a considerable loss or queuing delay caused by atm traffic shaping, and this would end up providing inaccurate internet speed test results.is it megabits or megabytes?q) is mbps in the speed test graphic referring to mega bits per second or mega bytes per second?a) its mega bits per second. a byte is a measurement of size while bps is a measure of speed such as sending something across the internet. an uppercase b always stands for bytes while a lowercase b always stands for bits per second.kbps is spoken as kilobits, equals 1,000 bits per second and is also abbreviated kb or kbitsmbps is spoken as megabits, equals 1 million (1,000,000) bits per second and is also abbreviated mb or mbitsgbps is spoken as gigabits, equals 1 billion (1,000,000,000) bits per second and is also abbreviated gb or gbitsinternet speed test conclusionin summary, we have put a lot of time into designing the most accurate and easy to use speed test on the internet, and for free! this whole project was inspired because i found too many broadband speed test sites that were either inaccurate, charging money or were just too confusing; users can simply start our speed test and know the results are accurate and instant!more cool speed tests we have two other very popular speed tests to help you measure your bandwidth, plus, if you own a website, you can even install them on your server!the broadband speed test made with flash and -the multilingual speed test made with java.internet speed testing on other servershere are other bandwidth tools (speed tests) that are hosted on high-end servers with plenty of bandwidth for those of you looking for further testing. i should also mention that these sites have been designed around our free speed tests.need help with the speedtest?questions, comments or concerns about our internet speed test? leave a comment below and ill do my best to respond as soon as possible!comments j luke says: march 24, 2012 at 11:35 am pl help , bought laptop with wi-fi from telkom . internet connection very slow . download speed 40.8 kb/s upload speed 13.0 kb/s suppose to get 384kbps. telkom techn support unable to help achal says: january 5, 2012 at 12:58 am hello,thank you so much, for all the informative results.i have a few questions if anyone can answer them.i am using a dell laptop, with windows 7 home, my internet connection is from cable integrated ethernet services, mumbai.my connection plan is 512 kbps unlimited.i am using a d-link router.i used internet download manager to download most of the times.now i have noticed this odd phenomenon.1) when i download from youtube videos or itunes installer from the apple website i get upto 1 mbps speed! (idm)2) when i download from torrents or any other websites, i get only 60 kbps.(i am not confused between bits and bytes)can some one explain me why this is happening and how can i download torrents and other softwares at such awesome speeds?the result of my internet speed test was 629kbps (download) and 707 kbps (upload).many thanks,achal. tommy says: october 26, 2011 at 1:53 pm i have a great variance in my download speed. usually its .5 mbps, sometimes faster sometimes slower. i use a links wireless router after going through my westell wirespeed dsl modem. all this equipment is on my desktop located downstairs. we rarely use this pc anymore as we both have laptops upstairs where it it much more convienent. my question is. would it benefit us speed wise if i moved the dsl modem and wireless router to the same room where we usually use our laptops. i dont care about the old desktop loosing the internet capability, but if this will not help our speed i wont bother moving it.thanks,tommy justin says: october 22, 2011 at 8:19 am hi jimsomething is puzzling me i live in south africa and and my isp is telkom. when my telkom bandwidth cap is reached i swop over to my banks bandwidth ( which is far cheaper) when i ran a speed test i find a odd phenomenon ie:telkom ping : 26telkom download speed : 387 kb per secondmy bank ping: 42my bank download speed: 498 kb per secondso my banks ping is poorer by almost half but it allows a higher download speed. whatever the figures are wheb i runj the tests the same always applies. i thought a low ping would always result in a higher download speed. can you commentthanks a stack jim says: october 21, 2011 at 8:38 am yes, simply run the internet speed test from your server. barat says: october 21, 2011 at 12:01 am hi i want to know the tool to test the bandwidth of my website, not my personal computer.can anyone help james says: august 26, 2011 at 2:44 pm hello.this is a wonderful site. all these tools you provide are very vital to alot of people. i utilized your internet speed test and discovered that my isp is ripping me off. thanks to you wonderful people i have corrected this issue. we are in the works of putting up a website and i will without a doubt place your link to our site. once againthank you for this site and generosity.warmest regards,james, sonoran one intell bryce says: june 29, 2011 at 8:44 am hithanks for sharing this..one request i have.. $ _post["testspeeds"] is there any chance you could make this output 3 different posts? for example $ _post["download"], $ _post["upload"], $ _post["laten"]?thanksregardsbryce jim says: june 12, 2011 at 9:09 am hi jenni,it means there are too many people using the speed test and the system is taxed. im working on a fix for this, but until then, you just have to wait a few minutes. jenni says: june 11, 2011 at 3:35 am um.what does it mean if you run the test and it says its working but it also reads connect time out? ken says: june 7, 2011 at 9:29 pm hi jim,they cap the speed, so you have to go through your dsl provider to get an increase jim keating says: june 2, 2011 at 6:50 pm i have an internet provider that is offering dsl very cheap; however, it is only 768 kb. is it the modemthat creates the speed? can i get a different modem and increase the speed? jim cocks says: may 17, 2011 at 11:19 am speed test wont work. dont use facebook. not computer savy. all i know is my old dial up was faster. jim says: april 11, 2011 at 3:47 pm hi jonathan,i would love to make this so that it reads perfect for you. is the software you use available for download? do they have a demo? i could then install it on another computer and use it as part for my testing process for not only the internet speed test but everything as well!thanks!jim jonathan says: april 10, 2011 at 6:49 pm hello. i am blind and use the jaws for windows screen reader. i can not see to use the screen and flash does not work for me [damn adobe all to hell!]. i thought since this speed test uses java it would work, but unfortunately i can only access the flash one which tells me nothing. i thought there would be some accessible button and real-time dynamic text? i allowed this second-level domain in noscript and made sure requestpolicy needed not make any cross-site requests to any other site and it does not [google syndication and facebook have nothing to do with the speed test i am almost positive]. can you please help? thanks in advance. valera says: april 5, 2011 at 2:06 am hello, jim.speed test is very good, but i living in russia and want to translate it.how i can translate text? can you give source for me, i translate and send to you back? rainer says: april 4, 2011 at 9:17 am question: will your speed-test (or any other speedtest for that matter) show the results of what my connection is actually capable of, or only show the results of the speed i am currently signed up for with my isp [ie. 512k/128k]? jim says: march 20, 2011 at 9:00 am thank you ed, i am :) ed says: march 18, 2011 at 5:56 pm enjoy the tea!ed jim says: march 18, 2011 at 6:37 am hi ed,its at the bottom of this page left side that says buy me a cup of chai tea.thanks :)have a great day!jim ed says: march 17, 2011 at 10:49 pm where exactly is your donation page? i would kick in a little if i could find it. jim says: march 12, 2011 at 9:16 am oh mark, how shall i respond :)do you have children mark? when youre on the computer trying to work and your child comes in says dad, when you tell me to wait, you make me feel that you dont want to play with me, what do you do? myself, i drop everything, hope that i can remember it all later and try not to think about it while im playing. little do they understand at this age youre actually trying to do something that will help them down the road. i work a full time job, i get home later than most and spend what hours remain enjoying the family if i can, i try to sneak some coding, maintenance and responses in before bedtime, but thats rare and when it does happen, im in trouble for not playing. i want to spend as much time with the family as i can, so most of my work begins after they are in bed; i then crank it out past midnight. vacations, visiting relatives, spending time with friends and anything extra makes it that much more difficult.i probably have too many sites but try to hit them all and respond to as many as possible. i try to catch up often, but its difficult. if im lucky, others will chime in and provide their expertise and answer questions which is a big help. i make enough to pay for hosting expenses and some extra, but its more a love of programming than anything.i share all this with you so that you have a better understanding of what a one person goes through to provide free applications and services to the general public. a lot of people use my tools and profit from them, unfortunately, a few expect the same level of service as a company with commercial products and ample staff; whats sad, is that these same people never once took the time visit my donation page and buy me a cup of chai as thanks. i try not to let those people get me down and remain positive. mark says: march 9, 2011 at 2:48 am after reading my last post, you may have the idea that i dont appreciate all the great information you do provide. that is not the case. ive learned a great deal from your information and am thankful for people like you that like to inform other, less technical people. do keep up the good work. but dont give up on trying to improve your site.thanks again mark says: march 9, 2011 at 2:37 am jim,why is it you only answer a select few of the comments here when people practically beg you for more information or help? since most of the comments here have existed for literally months, you arent overwhelmed with comments and questions. how about some good old-fashioned good manners and service? since you have gone to the trouble to set up this area for posting of comments. if you are not going to do the right thing, then just simply discontinue the feature since the service is not being performed anyway. you will lose less consumer interest and traffic that way and people wont be so annoyed with you. you would actually see an increase in traffic because less people would abandon you for lack of your interest. then set up a special page where people who are having trouble with your site can get a response and follow up with actual useful answers. a faq page will help keep repeat questions down. hard to believe a site as big as this and as well written. does not have a faq page. livingston hinckley says: february 24, 2011 at 9:48 am im really confused here. i have tried your speed test (auditmypc.com speed test the first one shown), and it shows speed results close to what my line should deliver (2741/619 on verizon dsl 3m/768k). next, using your \broadband test\ i get (139k/135ms/712k). this is consistent after updating java to 1.6.0_24 (64 bit xp). i had previously checked several sites on xp64, win7-64, and ubuntu 10.10 using ookla and on dslreports flash and java, and finally on fios bandwidth test site. all of these tests show results similar to your slower results. next, the detailed test at um-flint (speedtest.umflint.edu/ only on xp) notes packet queuing took place and \thoeretical network limit of 0.3mb/s,\ with 691kb/92kb speed. yes, there are lots of variables and i m just off extensive repairs and updates by verizon on their copper and plant setups. the download speeds dropped after the \fixes\, so i wonder if some kind of traffic shaping may be at fault. eric says: february 24, 2011 at 7:01 am excellent speed test tool amal says: february 20, 2011 at 1:35 am i hav put this speed test in my site ::: but getting download error when running speed test ;; can anybody help pls jim says: february 18, 2011 at 6:01 pm hi ed, not at all and its my favorite speed test. i am working on this and it should be back up and running by next weekend. please, feel free to remind me if you cant use it by thenthank you! ed says: february 14, 2011 at 8:06 am have you abandoned this test? basically it never works, even 5 a.m. i get connection refused. ive grown to rely on this version i find its accurate even when others are failing due to network congestion. i would not mind paying a small fee to access this test. bob ryan says: february 13, 2011 at 4:01 pm i been getting the same error message for 3 weeks saying connection refused. jose soria says: february 12, 2011 at 8:57 am please i help? ok my click not work? trust me that internet speed test? im fixing you please dont delay? ok i hope all right a good! thank you! connexus says: february 7, 2011 at 11:12 pm sometimes the firewall will slow down the internet speed, make sure you will close unnecessary function of the anti-virus software. jim says: february 1, 2011 at 9:12 pm hi patrick,i get slammed with users at times and this is the resulting message. i just placed a link under the test to my facebook speed test in case this happens again.thanks,jim patrick says: january 31, 2011 at 9:29 pm ive used internet speed test often, although not for several months. my isp changed my connection speed yesterday and ive tried to test it several times today but havent been able to connect. the error message that i receive is connection refused: connect. i have the latest version of java installed (java console 6.0.22 + java platform se 6 u23 6.0.230.5 for firefox) and the other speed tests on your site work fine. ideas?

this really p. me off, they should fix the root of the problems and not work on silencing evidences watson says: december 18, 2010 at 9:57 pm thank you (in tahitian maururu) for the service. a reliable speed check is most appreciated here deep in the south pacific. we are supposed to have a 2mb connection via hawaii and our new fiber optic connection but poor mana hasnt figured it all out yet and the infrastructure is pathetic. nonetheless its wonderful you are there. sorry my english isnt the best!happy holidays matty says: december 13, 2010 at 9:55 pm for some reason every time i play cod i always get red or yellow bar,, i have to best internet around youtube video loads within 5-10 seconds, all that stuff but when it comes to this it just lags and drops in and out, 3,2,1,2,2,2,1, 2,3,2,1,2,3,3, 2,2,1,1 1 being red 2 being yellow 3 being bright green, and everytime i play black ops on my xbox 360 slim i always get this annoying bullet lag with red bar. i no for a fact, i have good internet and fast internet as on my macbook, youtube and images for example load really fast. i have toyed around with my ip address settings, and opened gaming ports from, i am all out of ideas can any one please!!!! help!!!!! joanne says: december 13, 2010 at 8:29 pm i thought i had installed the optimizer for wildblue. evidently, i did something wrong! in the last few days i ve gotten word from google, which is running wildblue mail that i cannot use it because of low speed. its nigh unto impossible to do anything tonight. i dont know where to start! i have a wildblue file in my hard drive filled with items. idont know if old or new. best i call wild blue?i have suspected something wrong as it takes eons to do a thing!any ideas?? i was going to check the band speed but it mentions needing java to work, which i dont use but have found in the hard drive. that, also, recommends getting in touch with them. hmm. guess ive come to the end of my g4 mac. v 10.4.11! could that be? jim says: december 6, 2010 at 1:35 pm hey mike,hey, ive can build a speed test for the vic-20, but i think that the 1200 baud modem might skew the results a bit :)best regards,jim mike says: december 5, 2010 at 4:09 am jim,i have an old vic 20 (still works) and i think it would take more than a few modifications..it would be like trying to stuff an elephant into a vw :)thanks for the great test charles blakey says: november 27, 2010 at 1:43 pm thanks for the internet speed test. i am using it on my website with your credit image.regards,chuck blakey jono says: november 27, 2010 at 9:02 am this test gives me 2124kbps for download and 468.2kbps upload, which is higher than the other testing sites ive checked. thanks! sudesh215 says: november 22, 2010 at 3:11 am i need a help.. couple of vedio ago my internet vedio buffering speed was slow. i was watching movies very good at night.. but now i cant . but my internet speed ok ( isp said it) i cant watch movies as before.. buffering.. plz help me.. i don\t have any option.. why my internet vedio buffering upset suddenly! ( youtube working fine) megavedio and other vedio sites not working good! mark says: november 20, 2010 at 12:19 pm internet speed test and broadband speed test have been my reliable go to tests for the last few years. i use a macbook pro with osx 10.6.5 and usually have used camino as my browser, along with safari or firefox when ive having slowdown or connection issues. recently ive begun to use chrome. it is fast.ive had a supposedly 7 mbps dsl connection with qwest which was consistently testing at 5-6 mbps and have switched to a new clear. com hotspot using 4g technology, to save money. ive been trying to run tests at different times with different testers to determine if the switch is going to be acceptable. (early results show it is, with bursts of speed to 8-9mbps and consistent results at 4-5 mbps, a little slower, but acceptable)now, the internet speed test gives a connection refused warning, except in camino, which doesnt give any type of reason for not running the test. all 4 of them show a split second image of the normal progress bars with working showing and then give the connection refused warning. i am conducting the tests with each single browser running alone and with all 4 running at once. no other apps running at all. im using airport as my connection to the 4g hotspot modem. i have the latest versions of java and of flash installed. the broadband speed test consistently works fine, as do testers on another site, altho your broadband speed test shows almost half the speed that the other test does. could you tell me why so large a difference? and, will i ever be able to use your internet speed test while im connected using the 4g modem? i believe that will be the near future of wireless broadband connections, so id like to know how to do some accurate testing.thanks your help and for keeping these tests free!mark braulio darias says: november 20, 2010 at 3:20 am my click not work that internet speed test i told if all right? ok thank you! ot says: november 18, 2010 at 7:09 am i love the speed test and and appreciate the free service! i get a lot of junk on my computer that ends up chewing up my bandwidth, how do i stop these applications so i can be sure im getting an accurate reading?thanks!ot eduardo says: november 17, 2010 at 7:33 pm hi,ive been usign this test for a while, but in the last week, i started to get the connection refused: connect error. ive already opened the ports (though they were not closed) and tried disabling the firewall, but the error insists on showing. im also runing the latest version of java.thanks in advance.p.s.: the operating system is microsoft windows 7 ultimate (32 bit) kevin waddick says: november 16, 2010 at

november 8, 2010 at 6:46 am i just used this software, but i have seen lot of comments on it and this testify how powerful and reliable it is.its coolthank you, susan says: november 7, 2010 at 10:53 pm my internet connection, a comcast cable modem, is usually pretty fast, but tonight it is achingly slow. i tried running the speed test and keep getting the error message connection refused. i have run the test many times before and this is the first time this message has appeared. what do you think is going on? jim says: november 7, 2010 at 7:04 am hello beirirangu,i explain that error on this page near the top of the page, 5th paragraph down. the only time you are going to get that error is when your firewall prevents closes tcp port 8500 and 8600 to 8609 from communicating. the speed test uses these ports for the test and if you have them closed, youll get connection refused: connect. open those ports for 76.74.166.239 (my ip address) and your problem will go away you can allow that ip during the internet speed test and then close it down again if you like. beirirangu says: november 7, 2010 at 12:48 am i try to run the test with the latest java and knowing that i was connected, however i continue to recieve the message next to the start button that says connection refused: connect but i have no idea what im supposed to do to get it properly connectedhowever i did use your other speed test and said that i run aproximatly 940kbps upload and both 6700 as well as 9200kbps download (running it multiple times and seeing results within 10-20kbps of numbers estimated)can you please tell me why i cant seem to get a connection to this test? id really apreciate an accurate test and more information as this provided (at least from what i can tell)either way, thank you its just unfortunate that it dosnt work for me joe s. says: october 30, 2010 at 3:14 pm my dsl modem router recieves 8.1mbs but when i run speed tests it states i only recieve 5.2mbs why is this and how can i get computer to recieve total 8.1mbs martin says: october 26, 2010 at 8:03 am how do you acess the internet speed test? wheres the link? james p. madonna says: october 24, 2010 at 8:18 pm if my cable modem internet speed is 100 kbps, then what would my bitrate be in kbps for internet web streamed broadcasting? ben says: october 8, 2010 at 11:20 am i have intermittent voip problems. bandwidth looks great on tests but stumbles from time to time.is there a test somewhere that measures a connections ability to sustain a bitrate over a longer time than your test? not to saturate the pipe, but maybe 100kbps. generally i guess im getting occasional jitter or dropped packets, but its hard to quantify. herb bubar says: september 28, 2010 at 1:15 pm ottawa canada, i use rogers cable ultra-light and am having problems viewing and listing to video clips, especially the sits on aol. some video clips are fine on other sites.your speed test shows only a download of 542.9kbs, and upload at 273.9kbs. can this be the problem? thanks marco says: september 26, 2010 at 10:34 am works great, thank you.os = linux (ubuntu 10.4)browsers: firefox, chrome and operaisp: timewarner (roadrunner)

about hardware? jim says: september 16, 2010 at 10:17 am hi sam,there may be other programs that are running at startup and chewing up bandwidth in the background. even though its a fairly new laptop, there may be a ton of junk on there now that could be slowing things down, from starting the computer, to running applications, to surfing the net.try this, check out our speed up computer page and also our page on how to list running processes both of which list completely free software i use on a regular basis!another thing you can try to make sure its not the computer and indeed the programs running on the laptop, is creating a ubuntu live usb. you use a usb stick and install a bootable version of ubuntu (awesome os by the way!) on the stick which you can then boot up from and surf the web. its easy to make and allows you to take this internet speed test without anything else running in the background gives you the true speed!check out unetbootin.sourceforge.nethope that helps :) sam says: september 16, 2010 at 4:26 am hello,i am on my mothers computer, and it is very slow all of the time. i have a computer of my own and it is never this slow. i have tried to swich to firefox, wich seems a little better, and also added java to her computer. still it seems that it is very slow, and im not sure why. this is a fairly new laptop, she got it last christmas so im not sure what the problem is. anyway you could help? a.sian says: september 8, 2010 at 4:00 pm are you available to do custom speedtest app? jeevan says: september 7, 2010 at 10:37 am hi, i have to know in what

to compare that to the results of the internet speed test, laymen or not.glad you appreciate the service, there is a lot involved in doing so and nice to receive a complement from time to time. barnet says: august 21, 2010 at 8:41 am companies providing free services to the public are always highly appreciated. i conduct internet speed tests for my computer from time to time. i would like to ask if

pm java is not standard on most computers. stan fisher says: june 30, 2010 at 2:28 am hello again, jimthought i would update you on my recent speedtesting, for what its worth.i have been working hard over the past couple of months to increase my speed (previously 2.5 mb) by improving house wiring. i discovered that the easiest way to do this forget all that ringwire stuff was to fit an adsl plate at the master socket (this plate filters the phone and broadband signals at source) and run a data cable straight to my office at the other end of the house.this cost virtually nothing but has had a triple benefit my speed is now a rock solid 5mb, i have wonderfully clear phones, and i dont need filters on every extension. i dont understand why bt in the uk dont advertise this solution widely but persist with their stupid i-plate which just cuts out the ring wires.anyway, to cut to the chase, having at last achieved a stable connection i decided to repeat my broadband speedtest survey of several months ago.in the early hours of the morning (yes i suppose i must be a geek) i measured the speed using 10 testers.the results were quite interesting: 6 gave a result 5.1 +/- .1 mb, including the bt speedtester itself, two gave a result 100mb including namesco and your broadband speedtest, the one with dials, and your internet speed test gave 4.0. previous measurements using this test method over the past two weeks have fallen in the range 3.7 4.0, never higher.the computers, software, antivirus etc were as described previously.interestingly my hub has shown a rock steady dsl connection rate at 6.336 mb for the past 14 days which should yield, on previous experience, a measured speed of 80% connection speed = 5.1 mb.the empirical conclusion one might draw from this is that when one has a stable speed, your internet test seems to underestimate it relative to other methods.i hope this stimulates much more interesting comment because i enjoy the discussions.thanks. tenzin says: june 25, 2010 at 1:04 am thanks.. worked fine for me. ramreddy says: june 24, 2010 at 12:46 pm very good test, thank you! jim says: june 24, 2010 at 6:47 am hello tomas, sure, you can store the results to a database or file and assign them to a user, ip address, etc. whatever you can think of.however, the speed tests are for personal use, such as a personal website. if you want to use this for business purposes, well need to discuss terms. its inexpensive and nothing compared to other tests out there. let me know what you have in mind, where you would like to place it and well work something out, no problem. my email address is jim@auditmypc.comjim tomas says: june 23, 2010 at 5:18 am hi, were just looking for customized speed test for our website. our visitors are desktop videoconferencing users, who need to be sure, that they videoconference program will work through their laptops and hotel or airport internet connections.would be great to pick one of your tests and customize a bit with coloring, logo etc i am wondering, if there can be an output of measured values for further processing on our side, or maybe se can store measured values on our server as welllooking to hear from you. roni says: june 14, 2010 at 5:58 am great test!!! i have tried so many sites but this one is perfect. vinu kumarr says: june 12, 2010 at 1:00 pm my connection is very

second. i took the time to add a detailed explanation in my article above, see the section is it megabits or megabytes?thanks for the question!jim poda says: may 27, 2010 at 6:08 am tom asked, is mbps in the speed test graphic referring to “mega bits per second” or “mega bytes per second”?there was no answer that i could see. it’s a valid question. larry says: may 26, 2010 at 3:21 pm cool site. i cannot get a graphic on the speed test. i am on an hp desk top using windows 7 64 bit. i did redownload and install java. no help. thanks, larry ed dewan says: may 24, 2010 at 11:36 am tom asked, is

fine to manage our program in internet.thanksmani jim says: may 18, 2010 at 8:23 pm thanks david, im glad thats fixed! i moved this site to a new server and a ton of time went into making sure everything moved over properly, turns out i missed a few, like the internet speed test!thanks to everyone who took time out of their day to drop me a comment! without that, i would not have found the problem!jim david johnson says: may 18, 2010 at 8:15 pm i just tried it, works great. whatever you did worked. thanks, dj. jim says: may 18, 2010 at 8:00 pm hi david,i just reset a number of items, can you try that again and let me know what happens?thanks!jim david johnson says: may 18, 2010 at 5:19 pm i have added internet speedtest to my firewall. port 8500, tcp. then i clicked change scope, then clicked custom list, then added 76.74.166.239 . i no longer get a connect time out, but it goes to working.., and it seems to get stuck. i have left running for several minutes with same results. thanks, dj. jim says: may 18, 2010 at 2:55 pm hi stan,thanks for the upload it does not look like you have anything running on tcp port 8500 and 8600 to 8609; however, i did find that my instructions at the top of this page were incorrect.i had the wrong ip address up there, the correct one is 76.74.166.239, so for those reading this, please make sure that you allow 76.74.166.239 to send and receive data on port tcp port 8500 and 8600 to 8609i know that you have turned off your firewall and still receiving the error, so im going to set up a new page with the internet speed test that id like you to visit if you have time.thanks! jim says: may 18, 2010 at 11:44 am stan,thanks for helping. can you do me a favor and choose start, run, and type cmd, that will take you to a command prompt.once at the command prompt, can you then type this command:netstat -a -b -o mydocu~1/openports.txtthat command will report any ports open and the programs that opened them plus their status. it also writes the output to a file in your documents folder as a file names openports.txtif that doesnt work, try this:netstat -a -b -ocan you please send me that file or copy and paste the output? the speed test uses ports to communicate and this will tell me if that port is being used.thanks! stan fisher says: may 18, 2010 at 9:49 am i use windows firewall on all systems turning the firewall off temporarily obtains the same result connect timed out. jim says: may 17, 2010 at 10:11 pm hi george,i dont think its the os or browsers, but the security settings.can you, and anyone else having a problem, let me know what firewall they are using or what their security settings are?i can not duplicate this problem, yet enough people are having problems that i must be missing something, so any help would be greatly appreciated!thanks! george says: may 17, 2010 at 3:24 pm getting connect timed out errorusing windows xp professional and have java installed[newest version}processor is amd 64

speedtester which is the approved tester for isp bt customers in the uk but takes an age to come up with an answer. currently i have three laptops connected to a bt hub, one wired and two wireless. two of these relatively new machines run fully updated xp and one fully updated vista(ugh). all have updated versions of java and various browsers, including ie8, firefox, safari. all three machines use avira for security.all three of these machines give the connect time out non-result using your speedtester, and have done, in addition to other machines i have set up over the past couple of months, in whatever browser configuration i use. avira is not the problem, i have used it continuously for two years. my house is in a rural setting, some way from the nearest exchange, so i only get a measured speed of around 2.5 m. my lines, filters, junction boxes have all been recently checked out by bt engineers. i am now using broadband watchdog for testing. if its any comfort namesco doesnt work either, giving ridiculous speeds of 40m or more!good luck. jim says: may 16, 2010 at 7:30 am stan,it appears that very few people are receiving this message, but id like to make it so that no one received this message. can you help and let me know what type of operating system and browser you are using?thanks! jim stan fisher says: may 16, 2010 at 5:57 am oh no, stan fisher doesnt any

is.thanks,david. tom says: april 27, 2010 at 10:07 pm is mbps in the speed test graphic referring to mega bits per second or mega bytes per second? linda says: april 27, 2010 at 5:13 pm do you offer a

problem is that your laptop is not running java. you need that, which is usually standard on most computers.here is what to do visit:java.com/en/download/and install the latest version of java and youll be all set or if you dont want to install java (cant see why you wouldnt), then use one of our other speed tests (see menu to your left).have a great day!jim carolyn mitchell says: april 27, 2010 at 12:40 pm apparently this speed test was not developed for testing laptop computers? do you have a test to evaluate speed levels on laptops? bailey says: april 18, 2010 at 12:25 pm howdy: i use
