guide, without weeks and months of endless studying...dear friend,on a beautiful late spring afternoon, this past year, a young woman received the devastating news. she had just gotten back her score on the act test. it was not what she had hoped for. in fact, it was not even close to the expectations she had and what she thought her 4.0 grade point average would help her score on the act test.the worst part was that she knew that she could never get into the university she had planned to go to with an act test score that low.then she remembered her friends and felt even worse. all of her closest high school friends had already gotten their act test scores back and had already been accepted into the university they all planned to attend together. she had been procrastinating about taking the act test, because she hated standardized tests, and this only confirmed her hatred.why do you have to take the act test to get into college? she angrily wondered.she didn't look forward to having to tell the embarrassing news to her friends. what would they think of her? she thought, eyes brimming with tears, as she imagined her friends starting college without her and the isolation and exclusion of being the one left behind.how to solve the problemunfortunately, this hypothetical situation occurs all the time. someone thought they were going to a prestigious university, told all of their friends, made plans for the future, picked out a degree, and then got an embarrassing reality check from their score on the act test.contrary to popular belief, the act test is not a measure of your academic performance, which is why students with a perfect 4.0 gpa rarely score a perfect 36 on the act test.the act test is quite simply a measure of how well you did on the act test, which can be broken down into individual subtest scores on the english, math, reading, science reasoning, and optional writing sections.colleges and universities use the act test as a standardized measuring stick to determine who gets admitted and who benefits from the best scholarships they have to offer. while it may not be fair, a student's entire academic career in high school can be completely overshadowed by a single score on the act test.that is the whole purpose of the act exam secrets study guide: to give students the keys to understand how to succeed on the act test.an act test study guide unlike any otherif you'd like to get the act test score you deserve, to quit worrying about whether your score on the act test is good enough, and to beat the test taking game, then this might be the most important message you read this year.our comprehensive study guide for the act test is written by our act test experts, who painstakingly researched the topics and the concepts that you need to know to ace your act test. our original research into the act test, offered by the act, inc., reveals the specific content areas and the essential skills that are critical for you to know on the act test. we've taken the information and developed a study guide that is guaranteed to help you be successful on the act test.now, we know you may be skeptical, so let us give you three good reasons we can back up what we claim:the three reasons to believe what we saythe first reason:our company's name is mometrix test preparation, and we have a team of standardized test researchers who have worked on developing our study guide for the act test. the standards for who gets to work on the team are very strict- we demand the best for our customers, and only those who met our exacting standards made the cut. the dedicated research staff have years of combined experience in mastering the content and skills necessary to succeed on the toughest exams.the second reason:some academic studies have revealed that test takers do not really benefit from the traditional test preparation process. but we knew there had to be a solution- if test takers were not doing well on the act test despite high intelligence, there had to be a set of secret keys to the test that would open the door of success for these test takers.we believe we have succeeded in finding the secret keys of the exam. what we found was surprising, and in some cases ridiculously simple once explained to the average test taker.we put the findings together in a thorough, concise study guide that we believe allows any test taker, at any skill level, to improve his or her results dramatically with a minimum of effort.the third reason:we created the product in part because we were frustrated by the options available to test takers who really wanted to do well on the act test.a common approach is to teach the material, instead of teaching the test. that's not necessarily good enough for the act test- you have to know how to apply the knowledge. most test takers already have a general knowledge of the material that will be covered on the exam.one reason some test takers do well on the day of the test is that they have made the critical connection between the material they learned and how to use the material to succeed on the act test.our guide addresses the difference between merely knowing the material and knowing how to use the material to perform on test day.you're going to save time, money, and aggravation. you'll learn to avoid the mistakes and the bad strategies that you've been vulnerable to. just for starters, here are some ways our product can help your score on the act test...the exclusive test taking techniquesexplains how the act test time limits are the #1 enemy of

paul l.my name is chris. i used the secrets study guide for five days. the study guide made the test so easy to understand. like you said this program is worth 100's of dollars. to me 1,000's!! thanks, chris g.i just had to thank you guys for the test prep! i bought the guide as a last minute prep, i mean maybe 5 hours before the test. like i said, i had zero preparation! i was nervous about the test let alone receiving the score i needed. i read the guide through only once before test time and needless to say, the only way i passed was thanks to your refresher!! brianjust dropping you a note to let you know that i am completely satisfied with the product. i had already taken the test once and landed in the 75 percentile of those taking it with me. i took the test a second time and used some of your tips and raised my score to the 97 percentile. thanks for my much improved score. denise w.i heard about your website from a friend. i am enrolled in a review course, and in hindsight, i wish i wouldn't have taken my review course and instead spent a fraction of the money on your program. thank you! zac l..warning: always look for these 6 criteriathere is a lot of confusion surrounding studying for the act test, and standardized tests in general. in our opinion, these are the 6 criteria you should always look for in a study guide for the act test:one: the guide must be written by writers who have painstakingly researched the topics and concepts needed to succeed on the act test. the blind cannot hope to lead the blind.two: the guide must be written in easy-to-use everyday language so all test takers can access the information.three: the guide must be to-the-point, with no fluff to distract the test taker from the truly important information.four: the guide must address the test first, the material second. if the material was the only thing that was important, then every test taker that understood the material should get a perfect score- that doesn't happen because there's a difference between simply knowing what's on the test and the way you perform on the test. you want a study guide to close that gap.five: the guide must motivate the test taker to actually study for the exam. if the guide is hard to read, the time spent studying will be slow and painful, and the results will be meager.six: the guide must be guaranteed- if you don't pass with flying colors, you get your money back- no questions asked.you get at least 10 times your money's worth!when you consider what's at stake with the exam, we believe the value of our study guide gives you at least ten times your money's worth.in summary, here's what you get:when you buy act exam secrets, it includes-the 5 secret keys to act test success:time is your greatest
