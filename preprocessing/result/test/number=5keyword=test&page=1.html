always given me a sense of dread, even when i'm adequately prepared and know i will do well on the test. through high school, college, and then graduate school, the tests seemed to only get more complicated and more important. preparing for the next difficult standardized test in my immediate future became a way of life for me.planning when to study for your testas you prepare for your test, you want to make sure that you start soon enough. knowing when to begin your preparation process is critical to having enough time to prepare, without feeling rushed. adequate preparation time has become increasingly important as test takers lives are increasingly rushed and often feel as though they don't have enough time to prepare for their test.the amount of time that is necessary to prepare depends on the individual, as well as the score the test taker hopes to achieve. if you are a quick learner, then you won't need to spend as much time preparing as someone that absorbs material and concepts at a lower rate. if you don't need a very high score in order to accomplish your goals, then you also won't need to spend much time preparing. however, if you need a high score, then it will require additional study time.test preparation resourcesthere are many resources that you can use as you begin the test preparation process. you will find much information about most
