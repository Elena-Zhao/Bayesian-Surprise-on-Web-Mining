good photos are difficult to find for cheap. news sites might as well pay people on staff for images rather than istock or ap.news sites will still need a few good writers to stir up meaningful conversations and thoughtful analysis. but photographers will be the people the writers can thank for their paychecks. their articles will steal pageviews and support publications in the rapidly approaching, mobile-first world. facebook linkedin twitter google+ email email share share tweet share email share on facebook share on twitter share on linkedin share on google plus email recommended for you comments comments on this post are now closed. insiders 0 all comments 18 apply to be an "insider" loading photographers will soon be the most valuable people in the news room photographers will soon be the most valuable people in the news room soon, they'll be putting writers out of jobs. get tech emails alerts sign-up learn more tech select tech chart of the day business insider select 10 things in tech you need to know mobile insights bii mobile insights more featured business insider select tech select tech chart of the day markets chart of the day 10 things before the opening bell instant mba breaking news business insider events entertainment entertainment select sports select finance finance select markets select monday scouting report your money select financial advisor insights smart investor strategy strategy select advertising select retail select careers select advertising: the brief politics politics select military select law & order select life life select transportation select education select tech enterprise select science select mobile chart of the day e-commerce chart of the day payments chart of the day digital media chart of the day charts of the day sports chart of the day top 10 things 10 things in tech you need to know closing bell advertisement your money nasdaq composite 4,631 +64.6 (+1.415%) s 500 2,018 +23.4 (+1.173%) nyse composite 10,845 +0 (+0%) sponsored by linkedin pepsi ceo indra nooyi gave the perfect advice for getting noticed at work steve jobs’ ideas were so brilliant he would leave employees ‘dumbfounded’ in meetings microsoft fires global advertising sales team login with linkedin to see what your friends are reading on business insider. login with linkedin no articles have recently been shared in your network. more featured harvard management legend clay christensen defends his 'disruption' theory, explains the only way apple can win more the bi interview » 6 interesting things we learned from entrepreneurs about starting a business more fast track qa » wall streeters are heading to this safari resort for seriously luxurious african adventures more out of office » general electric cmo beth comstock does some of her best work 36,000 feet above ground more anywhere workplace » welcome, ! you are logged into facebook social: your activity| these articles have been shared on your timeline. you can remove them here: options notify me when a story is shared. yes no welcome, ! you are logged in with google social: your activity| these articles have been added to your google activity log. you can remove them here: options notify me when a story is shared. yes no watch & learn scientists have figured out what makes women attractive how to get a dancer's bodywomen are going crazy over these no-underwear yoga pants trending the hive what smart people are reading 6 the pierre omidyar insurgency -- nymag 6 podcasting - avc 5 internet archive now lets you play900 classic arcade games 5 fundraising acceleration is the new vc investment thesis |techcrunch 5 everything you think you know about the news is probablywrong 4 what's behind the great podcast renaissance?
