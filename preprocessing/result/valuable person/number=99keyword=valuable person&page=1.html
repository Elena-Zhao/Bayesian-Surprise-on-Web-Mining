all people are valuable | thoughts of a united methodist pastor about thoughts of a united methodist pastor sometimes cynical, sometimes excited, always seeking 19 jul 2013 3 comments all people arevaluable ive been thinking about the importance and value of all people.  two incidents have brought this to the forefront.  sunday morning one of the local tv stations called the church to see if we were going to be talking about the george zimmerman not guilty verdict.  i understand the media attention on this trial.  i also understand that the attention centers around the racial aspect of this trial.  my heart breaks for trayvon martins family.  having a fifteen year old son, i cant imagine the pain of having a child killed.  however, i have never gotten a call from a tv station asking about a murder trail regarding someone who got killed in the west end.  arent the people killed in the west end, as a result of black on black violence, as important as trayvon martin?the second incident happened a few weeks ago with a police standoff in indiana.  a police officer was shot in the foot a non-life threatening injury.  the authorities in louisville closed streets in downtown to allow the ambulance unimpeded access to the hospital.  i have never heard of streets being closed so a shooting victim in the west end could get to the hospital.  i have nothing against the police officer.  i have a great appreciation for law enforcement.  i appreciate all they do to keep us safe and that they are willing to put their lives on the line everyday to protect us.in the big picture, however, is trayvon martin or the police officer more important or more valuable than anyone else?  i believe god doesnt see them as any more important or any more valuable.  someone people in our society seem expendable.  they do not seem to have the same level of value as others.  as a follower of christ i find that to be unfortunate.  i hope to treat everyone as a person of value.  i pray the church could demonstrate to the community that everyone is valuable.garyshare this:twitterfacebookgooglelike this:like loading... posted in valuable people single post navigation older entry 3

people of any faith want to feel that their god looks upon them with unconditional love. in the christian faith too many times it’s the people of the church, who are supposed to be the body of christ, that remind us that we are faulty people or less than desirable people and are some how “less valuable” than they are. ive learned by experiencing the cold shoulder of the church. i believe jesus did just the opposite. it was the meek , the poor and the oppressed that he championed for, “what you do to the least of these you do unto me” (matt 25:40)it has been my experience that the people of the church (and for people reading this i mean the universal church not this particular church) somehow have gotten the idea that if they show people they are valuable (or love them) it is the same as admitting “they are just like themselves” and they cant accept that. they can’t accept the fact that a poor person is the same as themselves, or a sinner is just like them, or even people that secular society finds reprehensible is just as equal as they are in god’s eyes. loving / valuing a person is not the same as accepting the action but it becomes an act of transformation for the unvalued people of society. sadly the church has become a place of judgment and not place of transformation. billy graham was once asked why he attended a support rally for bill clinton in the wake of his “sex” scandal while in office. mr. graham just said “it is the holy sprit’s job to convict, god’s job to judge and my job to love.” its the churchs job to truly love and transform lives and not judge.gary i believe your mom once said “you don’t really know someone until you winter with them”. i would encourage the church to “winter” with people so they can see we are all alike and then loving and valuing one another can grow. yeah its going to take an investment, a time investment that is, but how valuable would people feel if we all took time to get to know them and how blessed would the church be by doing this and what a great opportunity to transform lives. reply annette ellis on july 25, 2013 at 3:57 pm said: gary,i couldnt agree with you more and i also love the fact that you stated so clearly that you are a follower of christ. it isnt about race, gender or religious affiliations but instead about the teachings of christthanksannette reply anthony smith on july
