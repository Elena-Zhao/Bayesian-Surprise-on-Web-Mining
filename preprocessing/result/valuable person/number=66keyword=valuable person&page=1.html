i just wanted to know what you all think makes a person valuable. i think a lot of us have a low opinion of ourselves and maybe it would help to explore this topic. what do you think it takes to have a healthy self-esteem? if you had a very low self-esteem and you were able to raise it, how did you do it? 04-26-2006, 10:11 am #2 (permalink) misplaced status: sas member join date: apr 2006 posts: 11 it takes a lot of positive experiences and positivity in our thinking maybe? i dunno.. i have very low self-esteem, especially after social situations. 04-26-2006, 12:02 pm #3 (permalink) melusine status: sas member join date: jun 2004 posts: 1,342 i suffer bouts of very low self esteem, i think that with a negative self image and not enough positive experiences with others has made me feel like that. first, you need to understand that you're not inferior to anyone and you need to instill some positive self-affirmations. i think you need to question why you feel you don't have value and challenge those beliefs. it also helps to have good experience with people and form friendships. but you also don't need to rely on other people to feel good about yourself. __________________ be glad of life because it gives you the chance to love, to work, to play, and to look up at the stars 04-26-2006, 03:46 pm #4 (permalink) coldfury status: sas member join date: nov 2003 gender: male posts: 2,108 a person's value is in the eyes of the people around them __________________ just one more song to slay this earth and i can't explain myself just what it's worth it was all i had, but not all i'd need and i can't escape the fact that i still bleed 04-26-2006, 04:26 pm #5 (permalink) guitarik status: sas member join date: apr 2006 posts: 85 some times a so called friend tells me i'm a loser , and that i'm ef'ed up. tell's me i should work out ,eat this way, take this vitamin ,dress this way, ,basically what i should do to be more normal. lol __________________ kinda quiet 04-26-2006, 09:01 pm #6 (permalink) perfectlycalm status: sas member join date: nov 2005 location: 20/f perfectly anxious posts: 167 when my self esteem is higher i doubt myself less. how much do i doubt myself on simple things to more important things? when i'm less doubtful, i trust myself and everything about me is calmer, and i have a clear feeling about the future and present. a valuable person can be grateful for what they have in their life, their family is important, people who love them are important. most times it doesn't help any anxiety go away, but it sure makes you more hopeful and have better self esteem. 04-26-2006, 11:23 pm #7 (permalink) kev status: sas member join date: jan 2005 age: 30 posts: 1,676 self esteem isnt about putting a value on yourself and others. i think its really about accepting everything for the way it is and making the most out of the way things are.i dont believe that any one person is more valuable than another. __________________ get some fresh air. it will do you good. 04-27-2006, 01:04 am #8 (permalink) nesteroff status: sas member join date: nov 2003 location: uk gender: female posts: 1,334 quote: originally posted by kev self esteem isnt about putting a value on yourself and others. i think its really about accepting everything for the way it is and making the most out of the way things are.i dont believe that any one person is more valuable than another. good point.i think people get too wrapped up in details and often define their worth by superficial things like money, jobs, looks, iq, etc. i try not to do this, but i have a tendency to judge myself in really superficial ways. i have a pretty low self-esteem, like many here. i have been trying to think positively, but it is a real effort. so far that seems to be the only thing that helps, though. positive thinking and self affirmations... and like kev said, accepting what is around you and yourself for who you are.i have only ever been my happiest when i could accept myself with all my faults. sometimes i've been able to do it, but often i forget, often when something bad happens, i stop focusing on the big picture (the big picture being that my reason for being here is to be happy) and start looking at the little details again. if all we look at are the details and compare ourselves to others, and define our worth by that, we are never going to be happy with ourselves. not only will somebody else always be ahead of us in some way, but there will always be people who will judge what we do, no matter what it is. we can't please everybody, and we cant be perfect, and by perfect i mean the standard society and possibly our families have set for us. i think valuing and loving ourselves in spite of all of that is really the key to good self-esteem.but the question is, how do you do that?? i wish i knew. i am hoping being positive will get me there, but i'm still not sure. 04-27-2006, 07:44 am #9 (permalink) christiem status: sas member join date: mar 2006 location: 30/f/pa posts: 209 i agree with kev. i also don't mean to get all christlike in this section, but i am currently listening to a joyce meyer set of tapes on self confidence. she says that as long as we search for confidence in others or in ourselves, we will be disappointed. she says that true confidence can come from christ only and if you put all your confidence in him, you needn't worry. you will have all the confidence you need.i found this very powerful, since i have been searching for self confidence since i was a child. i only learned this yesterday, so i am not saying this was a miracle cure or anything, but if you have faith beliefs it is something to ponder.we are human and bound to make mistake after mistake. in fact, she said that if we look too hard for self confidence, god will find ways of knocking us off our feet to demonstrate that it comes from him alone.it really made me think, because every time i think i have some confidence built up, i do something that makes me feel like a fool.again, not one other person has to agree with me , i just wanted to share what i learned that i found intriguing. christie __________________ i am just a butterfly trapped in the body of a caterpillar. 04-27-2006, 09:36 am #10 (permalink) truseeker777 status: kept in his hands join date: nov 2003 location: arizona gender: female age: 48 posts: 1,334 i totally agree with you christie. __________________ no act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted... ~ aesopoutcast press - hope thru art - 04-27-2006, 10:30 am #11 (permalink) christiem status: sas member join date: mar 2006 location: 30/f/pa posts: 209 quote: originally posted by coldfury a person's value is in the eyes of the people around them i'm sorry that i have to disagree. someone else cannot determine our value or our worth. who are they to be the judge of how important or unimportant yours or my existence is. nor is our value in those things that we are able to do or not able to do.our value lies strictly in how we feel about ourselves and where we get our strength. if you have faith then your value is determined my god alone. if you feel your value lies in your possessions or in your abilities then chances are you will never fill the holes that truly determine our self worth. you will never have enough things or friends to make you truly happy and self assured. __________________ i am just a butterfly trapped in the body of a caterpillar. 04-27-2006, 11:24 am #12 (permalink) coldfury status: sas member join date: nov 2003 gender: male posts: 2,108 quote: originally posted by christiem quote: originally posted by coldfury a person's value is in the eyes of the people around them i'm sorry that i have to disagree. someone else cannot determine our value or our worth. who are they to be the judge of how important or unimportant yours or my existence is. nor is our value in those things that we are able to do or not able to do.our value lies strictly in how we feel about ourselves and where we get our strength. if you have faith then your value is determined my god alone. if you feel your value lies in your possessions or in your abilities then chances are you will never fill the holes that truly determine our self worth. you will never have enough things or friends to make you truly happy and self assured. i don't feel my value lies in possessions. my value lies in who i am and what i am. i have nobody in my life which says enough about my worth as judged by the people around me. __________________ just one more song to slay this earth and i can't explain myself just what it's worth it was all i had, but not all i'd need and i can't escape the fact that i still bleed 04-27-2006, 12:58 pm #13 (permalink) atticus status: user requested permanent ban join date: nov 2003 location: st. louis age: 57 posts: 3,567 quote: originally posted by coldfury i have nobody in my life which says enough about my worth as judged by the people around me. i've certainly felt this way, and rarely now i still fall into the trap (i think its a trap) of judging myself better or worse based on how others respond to me. yet much of what people respond to in me or anyone are traits mostly outside our control. do we deserve credit or blame for our height, eye color, voice, or skin tone? some attributes give us practical advantages socially and professionally. that i don't have an abundance of some of those attributes can pain me if i choose to focus on those things. i try instead to honestly evaluate my strengths and limitations, and if i judge myself at all, its against a standard based on what i can realistically expect from myself. i'll admit that is much easier said than done. 04-27-2006, 05:47 pm #14 (permalink) spb123 status: sas member join date: dec 2003 posts: 268 i view self esteem as unconditional--you have inherent value. the only question is whether you want to believe it or not. 04-27-2006, 07:50 pm #15 (permalink) coldfury status: sas member join date: nov 2003 gender: male posts: 2,108 quote: do we deserve credit or blame for our height, eye color, voice, or skin tone?
