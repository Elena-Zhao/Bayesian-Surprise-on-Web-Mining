the 10 most valuable autographs of living people style food drink entertainment tech gear sports more submit the 10 most valuable autographs of living people by a.j. green | 11/03/2006 | mind, body soul money | comments facebook twitter stumble google+ save i was born on the day they landed on the moon and i have always wanted a picture and autograph with neil armstrong. when i saw how expensive his autograph was i decided to see who the most valuable living people autos are and couldnt find one so i made my own. these values are opinions combined with some of my own research. they may not be entirely accurate but pretty close. obviously the value depends on quality of autograph and what is signed. i am basing the prices on just a signed flat white sheet of paper. sure you can find these autographs cheaper but they are based on prices of major dealers. i am sure i have missed a few people. feel free to comment with who i forgot and a source for the pricing. i will add it or continue the list on to 20. major source of info is stanley gibbons autograph index 100, ebay, and countless pages on the internet, most of which gave me absolutely no help at all. (update: it has been pointed out that j.d. salinger and thomas pynchons autographs are worth $40,000 plus each. when i update my lists i will include them. please keep them coming)1. neil armstrong $6500 (based on ebay auctions) he stopped signed in 19952. steve jobs $5000 + nobody knows how valuable this would be as he just doesnt sign for anyone and an autograph has not been for sale for many years.3. tiger woods $2800 sure you can buy plenty of fakes on ebay but this is what a real autograph from a trusted professional dealer goes for.4. bob dylan $2600 living legend with high demand5. paul mccartney $2350 need i say anything.6. j.k. rowling $1900 doesnt sign nearly as much as she used to. demand is very high.7. russel crowe $19008. elizabeth taylor $18009. madonna $160010. pele $150011.. santa claus $1000 (just kidding)12. the trading godess. i would rather have a kiss than an autographall these autograph prices have increased more than 100% over the last 10 years and some by over 1000%. when you visit stanleys you will see he believes the top 100 autographs return are better than stockthanks for reading. for more funny ass comedy you have to visit ugoto.com and dont forget about daves dailyfeel free to search more about this on googlewallstreetfighter.blogspot.comweb tags:most viewed, top 10 lists top viewed stories speakeasy acting, comedy and strong spirits converge in speakeasy. when host paul f. tompkins interviews entertainers—key and peele, alison brie, rob delaney, zach galifianakis—about all sor ... 13 things to look forward to in your 30s you’ve probably been told that your 20s will be the best years of your life. as someone in their 30s, i can tell you honestly that nothing could be further from the truth. here are ... for the win looking for the best way to look busy at work, impress the ladies and open a beer with any household item?
