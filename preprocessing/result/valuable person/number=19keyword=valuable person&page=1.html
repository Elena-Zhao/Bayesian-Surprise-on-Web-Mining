cold wind blew: 貴人 = valuable person = benefactor?cold wind blewafter the misty clouds...fresh air greets a weary soul...tweet metwitter updatesfollow me on twitter monday, march 16, 2009 貴人 = valuable person = benefactor?what is a 貴人? how is it translated in english?here are 2 definitions i found from the internet which i find quite close to the meaning:"你生命中的貴人是在你生命中(曾)在任何一個時間或某個事情上面幫助妳的人只要你認定他幫助(過)你他就是你的貴人在中文裡頭貴人有可能只是有一面之緣的清潔工在跟你聊天的過程當中不經意地講了一句你正需要的話點醒了你對某件事情的疑惑讓你突然領悟該怎麼解決某個難題他就算是你的貴人了""chinese believe that 貴人 = valuable person who helps/enlightens us at a crucial time, who are very often seen as part of the divine plan. therefore, these answer providers are, in a chinese way, kind of like your 貴人."i personally think a more suitable word for 貴人 in english is "benefactor", though not in the total sense.how many times in ur life have u met someone like tat? and how many times have we ourselves been someone else's 貴人?i have lost count on the number of 貴人 i have met in my life (hmm...sounds rather ungrateful but i really cant recall at the moment), but i would like to think i have been other people's 貴人 and gave them a helping hand along the tough times in their lives.been told recently that i am a person's 貴人. was a little embarrassed at first when i heard that, kept thinking that i din really do much to help except talking and advising. however, as i cheer my friend up bit by bit, i realised that maybe i really did make a difference.thinking back, i believe i have also at other points in my past chanced on opportunities to help other friends.simple words of encouragement, comforting of a tired soul, "wake up call" for the lost/confused and empathy for another's fate.....these are some really valuable offers of help rather than the usual monetary assistance than most pple need in the present world (lots of pple are facing financial difficulties).it is actually great to be someone's 貴人...not for the possibility of benefitting from them but for the pure joy of giving someone a hand to stand up bravely through their troubled times. who knows? we may be in need of a 貴人 ourselves at some point in future and it will be comforting to know that maybe someone out there will be more than willing to help us too. ^_^posted bychristineat7:41 pmno comments:post a comment newer postolder posthomesubscribe to:post comments (atom)my musicmusic playlist at mixpod.comdo share ur bit in life powered bytag-box.com [close] name: url or e-mail: message: [smilies] search this blogloading...about mechristinegirl next door who is trying to find great meaning in life.seems unapproachable fierce on the surface but can be warm to friends close ones. i am loyal, sincere honest (a bit too straight sometimes). if u need a good listening ear or advice (though not guaranteed good advice..keke), do not hestitate to come to me k!view my complete profilelabelsfood trail(5)gatherings(12)idiots in the office(8)idols(1)jokes(5)lets work our imagination(3)movie/drama reviews(36)photoshooting(1)public enemy(3)stories(6)tiramisu hunt(5)travel log(8)vcd/dvd collection(1)videos(1)world cup(5)interesting linksandylee's blog-makeup tipsfireflystar's blogjiro wang (fahrenheit)stickgal's blogterence's blogxiaxue's blogfriends' linksariff's blogcharles' blogcheng's blogchris's blogcindy's (shaby) bloghl's blogjasmine's (egg) blogjune's blogkabish@maplestorymabel's blogmeng's blogolivia's (sea) blogruiyu's (ry) blogsam's (boi) blogsharon's blogsuhana's blogweini's blogfollowersblog archive 2011(4) june(2) april(2) 2010(41) december(3) november(1) october(1) september(3) august(3) july(4) june(3) may(5) april(4) march(3) february(3) january(8)2009(44) december(1) november(4) october(4) august(3) july(8) june(2) may(5) april(4)march(6)vcd dvd collection - as at 24 may 2010horoscopechinese new year 2009貴人 = valuable person = benefactor?mind throbbing weeksleepless night february(3) january(4) 2008(49) december(7) november(6) october(5) september(3) august(3) july(1) june(2) may(1) april(3) march(4) february(9) january(5) 2007(119) december(8) november(5) october(5) september(5) august(5) july(13) june(16) may(10) april(13) march(22) february(9) january(8) 2006(113) december(5) november(9) october(8) september(6) august(6) july(6) june(14) may(5) april(6) march(10) february(14) january(24) 2005(36) december(36)
