think this is grossly overlooked and underrated by most people.ive met brilliant people, impressive people,rich people, poor people, talented people, angry people, sad people, straightforward people, manipulative people, people that love women, people that hate women, people that hate men, and people that love men, great talkers, bad communicators..........every type of person there is........the list goes on and on...........but very rarely do i meet people that know how to be content and happy.most people i have encountered are always fretting over something. they can only be happy for a minute or two and enjoying themselves is always work.then before you know it, there they go fretting again, over analyzing and finding things to worry about.self induced stress is pretty exhausting and common.i am one of these people lol.i am always having to tell myself to relax and just be happy.there is a time and place for anxiety and stress, but i dont think we need to work ourselves into a tiz everyday.chronic stress and fretting leads to depression and anxiety.and its all downhill from there........or rather an uphill battle from there.when you cant be a happy person, and you get into the habit of being negative, that affects everything else.your ability to forgive, your ability to be in love, your ability to learn, and your ability to love yourself is all affected by how happy you will let yourself be.i have sabotaged myself a lot in the past. why?because being happy, really truly happy and completely relaxed seems to be a strange state for me to stay in.i always seem to find something to get anxious about.its the same insanity that goes along with me staying up late and not getting sleep.why do i avoid getting good rest? it will make me feel better, and have way more energy.so why would i stay up?getting good rest will ultimately make me a happier, more relaxed person.but for some reason, i justify why i should stay up late and not get as much rest. which then makes me tired all day, and more likely to get stressed by things i could handle easier had i been more rested.why do i do this? because i trick myself into believing that being happy must be more complicated.and it is for some, sure.but sometimes its just having good habits and taking care of yourself, and this can make it easier to feel good........and that leads to a more positive attitude.why cant i see these stupid mistakes and change them forever, and make my life a hell of a lot easier?because, i have not perfected the skill of being happy.for some reason, i must on a subconscious level think my life should be hard, and if there isnt some stressful pain in the ass thing to deal with, then im not really living. but that is all just bullshit.happiness, and being relaxed and open is the real way to live.so i think the ability to enjoy yourself and be content in life no matter how much you have or dont have, is ultimately the most valuable skill.i consider that a skill because i personally have to work at being able to just let go and be consistently happy.i am always impressed by my grandaddy because no matter what, he is always content.he has perfected this skill.but for me, i guess i like to keep my toe dipped in the crazy pond lol.i am trying to stop making myself nuts when everything is perfectly fine.lol maybe i should start skydiving to quell that need for a little scary stress.then i can hop up and unclip my parachute equipment and say, ok i was just scared shitless for a few minutes, sigh of relief, got that out of my system,now i can be perfectly happy for the rest of the week! =-d good plan.....embed quoteupvote 14+ comments loading... written 22 dec, 2013cannot add comment if you are logged out. liu yx gratitude is the key of being

successfully, one has to always have faith in oneself. one has to believe in the work he/she is doing. one has to believe he/she can be as good as the best in the business. id say, nothing can be achieved or accomplished without believing in oneself. people rise from having nothing to having practically everything in life. how? because more than believing on society, which told them they were good for nothing, they believed in themselves. another most importing skill one should have is appreciation and respect for others.in todays world, almost everything is taken for granted. appreciation is missing, and that is making people sick. people love to be critical and look down to every other person. respecting others and not being a conceited jerk is very important in life. finally, bidding adieu to your comfort zone. i know this is kind of a quora cliche, but ive tried it, and it is doing wonders. i think the whole comfort zone issue is just a conspiracy that has been passed down from ages. however, the ones who succeed are the ones who break out of these shells that are apparently holding you back and explore the outside world. lastly i would write one of the best poems ever written that explains the true essence of life and all that is required in a person to make him/her succeed!ifif you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you, if you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, but make allowance for their doubting too; if you can wait and not be tired by waiting, or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,or being hated, don’t give way to hating, and yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:if you can dream—and not make dreams your master; if you can think—and not make thoughts your aim; if you can meet with triumph and disaster and treat those two impostors just the same; if you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,or watch the things you gave your life to, broken, and stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:if you can make one heap of all your winnings and risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,and lose, and start again at your beginnings and never breathe a word about your loss;if you can force your heart and nerve and sinew to serve your turn long after they are gone, and so hold on when there is nothing in you except the will which says to them: ‘hold on!’if you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue, or walk with kings—nor lose the common touch,if neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you, if all men count with you, but none too much;if you can fill the unforgiving minute with sixty seconds’ worth of distance run, yours is the earth and everything that’s in it, and—which is more—you’ll be a man, my son!-rudyard kiplingembed quoteupvote

we all have our demons, and being able to recognize that everyone is fighting their own battle (regardless of how trivial it may seem to you) is a formidable skill to have, in my opinion. it allows for understanding, which often paves the way to friendship, rapport, and a multitude of other fundamental dynamics that allow us to foster real and lasting relationships (after all, isnt life all about the relationships we foster?).it shows character and charisma, and im always rather impressed when i come across someone who is empathetic towards others. in a way, it can be a bit surprising (in a good way) to meet someone who seems able to let go of their own problems to try and understand, and maybe even be a part of someone elses, even if just for a minute. the more you exercise the skill, the more it starts to develop into something that ends up being an important part of your character and persona. think about it for a second, and perhaps youll see that empathy is, more often than not, a foundation to any kind of relationship. whether its empathizing with your secretary who has the flu and is a tad late on that report, or whether its a professor who gives you a couple extra minutes on the test because you got a flat tire whilst cycling to class; it doesnt seem to matter whether its professional, personal, or sometimes even superficial, a little empathy can go a long way in my experience.we often forget, but weve all been there at one point or another.embed quoteupvote 3 comments loading... updated 19 may, 2013cannot add comment if you are logged out. julie

replying than to actually understand his point of view. most of the times we try to combat by bringing things from the past and let our preconceived notions about the other person cloud our judgement. we tend to focus more on the tone and our past conflicts/relationship than his ideas/ points. the best thing one can do in such situations is to respond to his points and not his behavior. if you have been hurt by his way of speaking, something he did in the past, you can always counter that later on when the main discussion has ended.in this way you will prevent fights from getting dragged on and also take the decision which is best for your relationship/ business. i fail a lot at this in spite of my best efforts. one thing i would like to change about me.embed quoteupvote 5+ comments

trick:respond calmly using as few words as possible. use simple sentence structure and key words only - going round the houses shows anxiety and indicates you may not know what youre talking about or what youre trying to say.finish on a strongest word/phrase you can think of that summarises your point (e.g. i said many times before i have dyslexia. no one can argue against learning disabilities, or and for this reason i find you misinformed)meet the other persons gaze and hold it for as many seconds as you can until you start feeling uncomfortable.do not say anything else, even when provoked. it is incredibly important that you dont. the awkward silence will make the aggressive person say lots of things in return (first of all, to fill the awkward gap in communication, then to counter-attack you) but none of their statements will have the same psychological effect as the last thing you said followed by your silence and gaze. youve won. the first person to speak after youve created the powerful silence loses. they will also know it and find it incredibly difficult to deal with your assertiveness. they will crumble. now think of different media personalities who use the trick all the time, or interviews with politicians. some celebrities unfortunately abuse it, just think of simon cowell.embed quoteupvote comment loading... written 25 octcannot add comment if you are

doesnt lead to success and soon makes ones life feel empty. genuine happiness relies on hard work, effort and dedication. being happy with your job means you either have to work hard to be promoted, or network and constantly take up new opportunities. to have a good family you need to first spend years of your life finding the right partner, and then dedicate lots of time to your children. to feel happy intellectually you need to put time into writing books, or doing advanced degrees. nothing comes easily and all of this takes time and effort.i went back to university last year, after 7 years away, and was shocked by the difference between the successful students in 2005 and the successful students in 2012. the top students now have been able to not only get a good degree, but also manage a number of internships and research positions, and set up a number of organisations, communities and startups. this kind of effort requires an impressive level of discipline, and the most successful people managed to achieve this at a younger age.you can train discipline, and if you do so at a very young age, your life will be more successful, easier, and ultimately happier. i
