i especially agree with the arrive early one. employers are always impressed by the willingness to show eagerness to get to work and get things done. thanks for sharing! reply adrian says april 5, 2010 at 7:07 pm point number quickly one ends up becoming an escalating case of unpaid overtime; he comes in five minutes early so she stays back ten minutes late then the other guy turns up half an hour early and before you know it everyone is working ten hours unpaid overtime a week and getting stressed and having a lousy life. of course the business loves it, meanwhile smirking out the other side of its mouth as it sends pathetic work life balance emails to everyone to read in their spare time. reply mark shead says april 5, 2010 at 7:20 pm usually people who are concerned about 5 minutes of unpaid overtime arent particularly concerned about trying to really advance in their jobs. also the vast majority of people looking for this type of advice are probably on salary anyway. reply jamie ross (mining man) says april 6, 2010 at 1:27 am five really great tips there! i particularly support number 2. in the industry im in (mining) people love gossip and all the latest rumours about the company and other people. its partly a product of a general culture of poor communication in the industry, but partly just peoples love of a juicy story.spreading gossip is a very quick path to being insecure about yourself and to alienating people around you. as a manager you need to listen for it and pay attention to the grape vine, but never spread something youve heard unless:1. you know it to be true2. you would say it to your boss or to the persons face who it involves.the other points in the post are great too, and very concisely put.thanks,jamie ross reply trevor allen says april 7, 2010 at 6:14 am i find this post of mark sheads a bit broad. item 4, i believe that once you achieve an aura of competence and diligence in an organization people are going to want your input. so i would take this story of mr. sheads former coworker not as a prohibition of what not to do just an ineffective way of controlling other peoples access to limit interruption. item 2, the definition of gossip depends on who is defining it. the benefit of gossip is that you can build up your network within an organization. i totally agree about not spreading negative comments though because of the risk of developing a reputation of a negative individual within the organization. as a manager, i think it is important to have knowledge of the local gossip to a) seem approachable and b) understand the morale of the department. if people are spreading negative gossip that suggests a lack of timely information within the organization. reply craig thomas says april 8, 2010 at 2:25 am nice post. being the peacemaker/making others look good in my opinion is all short-term. in the long-term, it wouldnt work out so well. peacemakers will be seen as wimps while making others look good will give you less status in the situation allowing your point not to be heard because theres someone else with a point, who youve made feel good who now feels better than you. reply leave a reply cancel reply your email address will not be published. required fields are marked * name * email * website comment you may use these html tags and attributes: a href= title= abbr title= acronym title= b blockquote cite= cite code del datetime= em i q cite= strike strong featured postsinterruption prevention strategiessimple time savings investmentsgoing back to collegegetting the most out of college5 efficient college tipsintuit productivity webinarbecoming selectivevletter handwriting fonthome office updatediscrimination against the unemployedmark shead copyright 2014
