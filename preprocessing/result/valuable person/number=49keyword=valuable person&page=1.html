(the buyer’s identity remains unknown.) what it’s worth today is anybody’s guess.6. 1849 coronet twenty dollar gold pieceonly one example of this coin is known to exist, and that specimen is locked away in the national numismatic collection at the smithsonian institution, making it unavailable at any price to collectors. besides being the ultimate rarity, this is also a coin with exceptional historical significance, for it is the very first u.s. double eagle (or $20 gold piece) ever made, plus it was issued as a direct result of the california gold rush. some believe that if this coin ever became available to collectors, it could fetch as much as $4 million dollars.5. 1861 coronet twenty dollar gold pieceadvertisementproduction of this coin was stopped by the u.s. mint due to late-breaking design revisions, but authorities did not receive word until after a few of the coins had already been produced and put into circulation. just two examples are known (although a third example of the 1861 paquet double eagle has been rumored to exist) and one of them can be yours if you can cough up 5.6 million dollars.4. 1804 ten dollar gold piecefor some reason, fewer than 10 of these coins were ever produced, and only three of them are currently known to exist. adding to the novelty, the coins were minted in 1834three decades after the date on the cointo be used in diplomatic presentations, making them part of one of the most famous sets in american coinage. while the 1804 silver dollar—also struck at this later date—is much better known, the eagle is even more rare and, as such, is seldom offered at auction. the only piece which has ever been offered in recent times was the one contained in the king of siam set, a complete proof set in its original case, which sold for $8.5 million dollars in 2005. of course, you don’t have to spend that much to get one of the other two proof coins; you can get it for just $6 million dollars.3. 1913 liberty nickelthough it seems only a fool would pay upwards of six million dollars for a five-cent coin, this particular piece of metal is highly unusual because it was somehow produced without the knowledge of its makerthe u.s. mint. not much is known about the actual minting of the 1913 liberty head nickels. since the mints were to start production of the famous buffalo nickels that year, no liberty head type nickels were to be minted that year. however, the die for the nickel bearing the year 1913 had already been produced and delivered and it is believed that five specimens were struck at the philadelphia mint before the die could be destroyed.one theory says that the coins were struck as advance test pieces while another theory proposes that someone illegally struck the five specimens before the dies were destroyed for fun. in either case, its clear that the valuable coins left the mint in some unauthorized fashion, and didn’t surface until 1920, after the statute of limitations for theft had safely run out. apparently, u.s. treasury officials have concluded that they were legally struck, making it possible to own one of the five known examples if you can afford the price tag.2. 1933 saint-gaudens twenty dollar gold pieceselling at auction in 2002 for a measly $7.5 million (and thought to be worth at least $10 million today), while its not the most valuable coin, the 1933 double eagle is perhaps the rarest and most famous. although 445,500 double eagles had been minted with the 1933 date, none were released into circulation because of changes made to currency laws during the great depression which took america off the gold standard. once it became illegal for private citizens to own gold coins, the mint melted down the entire 1933 run of gold double eagles and converted them to gold bullion bars. however, there is evidence that a mint cashier may have absconded with up to twenty of these expensive coins, which he sold over the years to various collectors. once the government found out, however, they confiscated them and as such, besides two examples made specifically for the smithsonian institute, only one example—a specimen once owned by egypt’s king farouk—remains. at least, that was the case until ten more examples were discovered in 2004 by an heir to one of the jewelers who originally sold a number of the earliest specimens, and their fate remains the source of considerable legal wrangling between the heiress and the government over their fate while they languish at fort knox. it will be interesting to see, should the 10 coins ever come to market, if the 1933 double eagle will retain its place as the worlds highest priced coin when the number of available specimens increases ten-fold. stay tuned.1. 1804 silver dollar the most valuable coin in americathe all-time most valuable coin one can own, a specimen in top condition can be worth as much as $47 million. with only 19 copies known to exist, its also the envy of numismatists across the country thanks to its rarity, design and beauty. what’s most curious about these most valuable coins is the fact that no silver dollars were minted in 1804. (actually, over 19,000 dollars were minted that year but they bore the year 1803 and were indistinguishable from those minted the previous year.) in fact, silver dollars dated 1804 did not appear until 1834, when the u.s. state department decided to create sets of coins to present as gifts to certain rulers in asia in exchange for trade concessions. the u.s. government ordered the mint to produce two specimens of each kind now in use, whether of gold, silver or copper and since the silver dollar was still in use but had last been recorded as produced in 1804, mint employees struck several dollars with an 1804 date. additionally, an enterprising employee of the mint in philadelphia illegally struck a few dozen more examples between 1858 and 1860 using the old 1804 die, most of which were confiscated and destroyed, but a few of which remain in private collections today._____________________________________________________________________________________jeff danelek is a denver, colorado author who writes on many subjects having to do with valuable coins, history, politics, the paranormal, spirituality and religion. to see more of his stuff, visit his website at posted in history | tagged american coins, cent, coin collecting, coins, coins of the united states, coins of the united states dollar, collectibles, collectors, currency, dollar coin, double eagle, famous coins, fort knox, gold, history, hobbies, jeff danelek, liberty head, liberty head nickel, louis e. eliasberg sr., martin a. logies, mint cashier, money, most valuable coins, nickel, numismatics, rare coins, san francisco mint building, silver, silver dollar, top 10 coins, top 10 list, toptenz, u.s. treasury, united states dollar, united states mint, valuable coins related poststhe levelland ufo case: texans including fire chief and sheriff see egg-shaped uforeasons why the u.s. government is bad for your healththe creepiest videos on youtube, part 3!the creepiest videos on youtube, part 2! loading... 10 responses fred october 13, 2010 at 5:48 pm | permalink very good. we needed a site like this for a long time. thank you reply shafeeque october 18, 2010 at 11:37 am | permalink old eeast india rare coin dated 1900 most valuable coin one can own, a specimen in top condition can be worth as much as rs. 25,000,000 the front of the dress has 4 panels. the bottom panel has 3 leaves at the left and a small flower at the upper right reply leonard ratzman november 22, 2010 at 12:33 am | permalink although the red book and major, population reports all agree that there were no, 1917, proof, buffalo nickels minted at the philadelphia mint, a few sources say that a few, specimen coins were created for presentation peices to selected, government officials (president wilson being one?) despite owners attempts to have these coins verified as proof coins, the consensus of opininion by grading experts over the years has resulted in rejection as genuine proofs. do you know how many were made, to whom they were distributed and are there any sales records of auctions that put them up for bidding? it would also be welcomed information if there was a source that outlines the conditions under which these specimen coins were struck. can you help? reply kevin december 15, 2010 at 3:36 pm | permalink great article; my favorite coin on the list is number 4, the 1804 ten dollar gold piece. reply j.c. october 3, 2011 at 4:04 pm | permalink the 1849 20 dollar gold piece is not even a pattern coin or was it ever us currency so it is not in the top ten coins of highest value however i use to think so as well the 1933 saint was not us currency so it too is disqualified and the population is not authentic it was artificialy tampered with it to is over priced as for the 1913 v nickel it is not rare even though there are only 5 known out of how many originaly made if the number is small this coin too is overr priced by 1000 s of dollars i have been a coin collector for a great long time so keep in touch reply bill december 17, 2012 at 11:14 pm | permalink the 1794 silver dollar while quite rare and with a couple exceptional specimens known still has about 150 examples known to exist and can be had for a price i agree also about the 1849 $20 not being for circulation all these are great and rare coins but i think this list should have the 1822 $5 with 3 extant and only one in private hands and the 1870 s half dime another unique coin and again privately held reply armo january 29, 2013 at 9:55 pm | permalink hi. i want to inform you that my friend in my native country has some of these valuable coins. for example, he has two of those 1804 liberty which is worth 47 million dollars each as written in this website. so, after reading this information, i became so curious about it and want to know more information about those 1804 liberty coins. i also can show you pictures of it if you want to. i want to make sure that those coins are original so what should my friend in my native country do in order to make sure it is the real one. thank you please email me back. reply clark february 5, 2013 at 2:33 pm | permalink sir, why not a 2nd top ten most valuable american coins for wider scope ?
