comments unfollow comments after the million-dollar, one-person business series ran on this blog, i heard from a number of readers who were very curious about what types of internet businesses are generating seven-figure revenues with no employees other than the owners. looking back at the census figures available, i didn’t get much clarity on what these businesses are doing, beyond what i already reported. hopefully the government will study them more in the future. however, i did hear from an internet business broker, jock purtle, who shed some light on how internet businesses are valued when they are sold. at his australia-based firm digital exits, purtle works mostly with u.s. businesses that fetch prices in the range of $50,000 to $2 million. he offered some interesting insights for readers who are not necessarily looking to create thenextfacebook facebookbut would like to be able to build a salable small business. if you’re thinking about starting a one- or two-person internet business and would eventually like to capitalize on your efforts by selling it to someone else, this kind of knowledge can be useful. the daily revenues you generate are not the only source of value. photo credit: jami3.org so which one-person internet businesses fetch the highest prices when they’re sold? they’re often the hands-off ones that require the least continuing maintenance by the owner, he says. here’s a hypothetical example purtle shared to illustrate how this plays out. say you own a blog that posts information about shopping discounts, linking to retail sites. you get a commission if someone goes from your site to the retail sites and buys something. you have 50,000 readers a month and earn $5,000 in commissions or $60,000 a year. your expenses for running the home-based site are $10,000, so you end up with $50,000 after subtracting expenses. a buyer for a site this size would likely be willing to pay 1.5 to 2.5 times earnings, or $75,000 to $125,000, in his view. “whether it’s $75,000 or $125,000 is based on a few factors,” he says. “how much time does the business owner spending working in the business? what type of traffic is the site getting? is it very reliant on google google? the more diverse traffic sources you have, the more stable the business is. are you very reliant on one income source? is there room for growth? what is the growth trend?” the sites that command about 3 times earnings are those that don’t ask the owner to make a relentless daily effort. these are very established ventures that have good systems in place that will allow a new owner to take over easily. “they don’t have to invest much time into the business if they don’t want to,” he says. generally speaking, he says, advertising or affiliate sites–meaning those that promote other sites in exchange for a commission or payment–are the most hands-off. if a site like this has a solid history and earnings, it will command more money than one that doesn’t. small e-commerce sites, which require more of an ongoing daily effort by the owners, will typically command lower multiples than a small affiliate site. of course, anyone who wants to build an internet business to sell should keep good records on traffic statistics, earnings and other details, he notes. and if you are planning to market it, have an idea of what size offer you would be willing to accept if you got one tomorrow, he advises. that will make it easier to be decisive if one does come along. looking at any business through the eyes of a broker isn’t a bad idea, even if you’re just starting out. you may want to sell it someday and try something new–like a long sabbatical. 7 comments, 2 called-out comment now follow comments following comments unfollow comments

unfollow comments chas 1 year ago your article is informative and interesting, but, many may be seduced by the dollar signs being thrown around. affiliate marketing is a lot harder of a nut to crack, than many lead people to believe, and the game has changed from the late 90′s and early millennium when several made fortunes through this model. many browsers no longer support cookies and customers who click on banner ads from other sites aren’t as easy to track. banner ads are also a dying breed of marketing in and of themselves. there are also many affiliate marketing scams out there, where the promoters of the ‘system’ promise instant riches and provide cookie-cutter sites to everyone who signs up through the web hosting site, that they themselves are affiliates of, and thus, the promoters of this ‘system’ pocket the commissions from the web hosting company, for all who buy into the scam. this scam has now moved into ‘blogging’, as well. being a middle-man earning commissions from other’s products, or services isn’t an easy path to tread. while producing your own product, or service may require more initial work, the rewards can be greater. permalink flag reply nick 11
