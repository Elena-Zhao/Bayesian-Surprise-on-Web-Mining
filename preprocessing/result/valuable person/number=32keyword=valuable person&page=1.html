are you morel likely to drop $50 on dinner for someone who might hire you or give you a promotion or are you more likely to give $50 to a guy with a cardboard sign standing at a nearby intersection? in both cases we lose $50 but in the first instance it is viewed as worth it because the $50 is more about us than it is about the other person.gods economy of worth doesnt work like that. it is a great concept because there is nothing we can do to make gods net worth go up. so our value in his eyes is not based on what we can do for him because he already owns everything. i love what randy harris says about this, there is nothing you can do that will make god love you more than he already does. that is a powerful concept. whether we have $1 million in the bank or are in debt up to our eyeballs, god still loves us because he does not love us based on our potential to elevate or advance his position in the world.what makes a person valuable? a persons value is assigned by the one who has created them with value and the standards of the world can never detract from that. so beautiful or plain, tall or short, skinny or heavy, wealthy or poorit doesnt matter. you are valuable to god and that means as christianseach and every person should be valuable to us as well. i wonder how often and how easily we buy into the worlds standards for what makes a person valuable rather than gods standard?share:facebooktwitterpress thisgoogleemaillike this:like loading...filed under: christianity, church, commercialism, culture, god, religion, theology, thoughts what church database software does your church office use?shaq dancing with jabbawockeez at the nba all star game 0 responses to what makes you valuable? tim archer says: june 11, 2009 at 11:31 am makes me think of this proverb:“he who oppresses the poor shows contempt for their maker, but whoever is kind to the needy honors god.” (proverbs 14:31)grace and peace,tim archer reply philip cunningham iii says: june 11, 2009 at 11:47 am luke 14! ive got a great sermon on tape from mark love talking about this.i wanna play with one concept though. you said, god’s economy of worth doesn’t work like that. it is a great concept because there is nothing we can do to make god’s net worth go up. so our value in his eyes is not based on what we can do for him because he already owns everything. except, our hearts, which he does stake an ownership claim on. he allows us to hold back, give to something else, or give to him.soooooosomeone who was deft at turning hearts to god might be someone who god values at a higher level, no? perhaps? i mean, james 5:19-20 saysmy brothers, if one of you should wander from the truth and someone should bring him back, remember this: whoever turns a sinner from the error of his way will save him from death and cover over a multitude of sins.doesnt that at least insinuates that there is a quid pro quo with god on some level?but then of course theres matthew 7 which saysmany will say to me on that day, lord, lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and in your name drive out demons and perform many miracles? then i will tell them plainly, i never knew you. away from me, you evildoers!so hmmmm. what do you say, dabbinator? reply mattdabbs says: june 11, 2009 at 2:03 pm this post is about gods value of us and not our value of him. i think you make some valid points of how we view god and the value we give him in our lives. so the person turning hearts to god and the people being turned are worth no more and no less than each other. that would make a nice followup post.i guess you could turn to the very next chapter in luke and read about how god is willing to leave the 99 to find the 1. is that about valuing one sheep over others or is the point the nature of god, who seeks those who are lost because they are just as valuable as those who are found? reply l1or says: april 26, 2011 at 11:24 pm there is so much truth in this post i found it really touching. just to add my 2 cents, im really just reiterating what you say in a slightly different way: i think its helpful to compare people with newborns. is one newborn more valuable than another? i think, no. they are all equal. so why then should that newborn suddenly acquire a different value upon growing up? our inner self the deepest sense of who we are as god sees it is the same in us as adults as when we were newborns. we may achieve all sorts of external things (money/ achievements/ prizes etc), but our core self stays with us and does not change in value. simply being a child of god, on earth, makes us valuable. it makes us all equally valuable. li-or reply leave a reply cancel reply subscribe posts comments recent commentsmark on list of bible blessings to speak over childrenphilip iii on the art of having conciliatory theological discussions – suggestionsjerry starling on the problem with source criticismroy on the problem with source criticismmatt dabbs on the problem with source criticism recent posts list of bible blessings to speak over children seeking allah, finding jesus: a devout muslim encounters christianity by nabeel qureshi the problem with source criticism logos giveaway contest the art of having conciliatory theological discussions – suggestions categories select category 1 corinthians 2 corinthians 20s 30s abortion acts of the apostles apostle paul archaeology baptism bible bible class bible curriculum bible resources bible statistics bible study bible translations biblical interpretation blessing blogging books calvinism christ christianity christology church church of christ church steps commentary communication communion community confession culture death deuteronomy discipleship doctrine education elders elijah ephesians equipping evangelism facebook faith family fasting genesis giving god gospel gospel of john gospel of luke gospel of mark gospel of matthew gospels grace headlines heaven hebrew hebrew poetry hermeneutics holiness holy spirit humor james jesus jonah judges judges kids kingdom living koine greek leadership life logos bible software love marriage messiah ministry miracles missional missional church missions missy morality new testament old testament parables paradigm issues parenting personal politics prayer preaching psalms psychology reformed movement religion restoration movement resurrection revelation romans sexuality sin small groups social media spiritual disciplines spiritual gifts spiritual transformation teaching technology thankfulness theology troubleshooting uncategorized videos wineskins womens roles worldview worship youth ministrywineskins.org links bobby valentinebrad palmoredan bouchellejay guinjohn mark hicksjonathan stormentjosh graveskeith brentonles fergusonmike copepatrick meadpaula harringtonsara bartonsean palmer go to topadministration logincopyright 2014 kingdom living send to email address your name your email address cancel post was not sent - check your email addresses! email check failed, please try again sorry, your blog cannot share posts by email. %d bloggers like this: skip to toolbar manage subscriptions view job listing log in register
