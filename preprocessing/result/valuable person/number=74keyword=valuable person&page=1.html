( matthew 6:26)"are not two sparrows sold for a cent? and yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from the will of your father. but the very hairs of your head are numbered. therefore do not fear; you are of more value than many sparrows. ( matthew 10:29-31)"what do you think? if any man has a hundred sheep, and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go and search for the one that is straying? and if it turns out that he finds it, truly i say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine which have not gone astray. thus it is not the will of your father who is in heaven that one of these little ones perish. ( matthew 18:12)what woman, if she has ten silver coins and loses one coin, does not light a lamp and sweep the house and search carefully until she finds it? and when she has found it, she calls together her friends and neighbors, saying, 'rejoice with me for i have found the coin which i had lost!' in the same way, i tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angels of god over one sinner who repents."
