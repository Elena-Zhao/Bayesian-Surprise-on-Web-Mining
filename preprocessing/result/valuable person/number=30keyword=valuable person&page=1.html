possibly something, possibly nothing. its objective, its subjective, its up to you to consider, its up to society to consider. extending the question, why should the human race consider itself more important than any other species? 1 0 comment wesley answered 4 years ago its often stated that all people are equal and no persons life is more or less valuable than anothers. institutionally this isnt true. for instance in civil court a fourty something with a good work record is much more valuable that a child. hence legalistically different lifes have different monetary values. when it comes to importance, many people die without much notice from others, but some die and it is newsworthy. source(s): me!!! 0 1 comment doug! answered 4 years ago it is false to say everyone is equal. to sustain our society we must say otherwise to satisfy those who arent as good as others. even if we dont talk about income, status, wealth or anything you can measure with today technology or techniques, genetics vary enormously in humans. eugenics is the study of selective breeding in humans. this is pretty harsh and was rejected after ww2. before ww2 however, many well respected people valued this concept, even if it was just a theory. a very harsh example of this would be a strong built man, living in an economy that only produces bricklaying services (simplified majorly) compared to a man who is disabled from the waist down. sorry if this offends but i really am just trying to prove the point. but i should also mention im a nihilist so w.e 1 0 comment zen answered 4 years ago in truth, all peoples lives are extremely valuable, so much so it is hard to choose one over the other. lives are hardly quantifiable. yet, on a personal scale, if someone means more to you (emotionally), it would also make him more valuable to you then another person would. for instance, a person would grieve more at a loss of a brother as compared to the death of a stranger. 1 0 comment cocoa dusted love answered 4 years ago nothing *should* make them more valuable, but in real life people who have important jobs are often favoured over say a homeless person. say there is only 1 liver, and both will die if they dont get the transplant, should the doctor give it to the high court judge or the homeless bum? in real life i think most doctors will give it to the more valuable member of society. 1 1 comment mars mission soon in a galaxy like yours answered 4 years ago unfortunately money. we argue about down loading music.. while people die because they come from a third world country they die because theres not enough food, medicine or water. and because not enough people care! best wishes. mars mission. 14th year psychology student. 4th year hypnotism student. 4th year self taught music student. 32 years qualified automotive technician. 1 1 comment kal alvar answered 4 years ago nothing can do that. all life is valuable and all life can be taken away in a second. there are lives of people who are in more important positions, but its just the fact that that person was born into that family as opposed to one that isnt important. you could have been born into a family in africa that has no food, no clean water, nothing except for each other. or you could have been born into a rich family of a king or queen. either way, your life is still life, so therefore its still important. 0 1 comment boat answered 4 years ago the beliefs, values, and perspective of those doing the valuing. i mean no disrespect to you, but in comparison to my own family, you have very little value to me. that is not to say that you are not valued by those around you. to me, however, my family holds a much higher value. when speaking in terms of society, i would say it is similar. societys view is based upon their ideas as to what is valuable. different cultures have different values and assess ones value according to these values. i do think that a general thought that nearly everyone adheres to is that a person who is detrimental to others in society is of less value to society than one who is not. the murderer has proven himself to be a threat to society, while the one murdered may have been quite the opposite. most would agree that the murderer is less valuable to society, being he actively harms it. as far as who is actually more important, i know of no such authority that can make that determination. a person may be important to a certain group of people, but i dont know if that actually makes him more important. like i said earlier, a persons value is determined by the one doing the assessing. my family holds a much greater value to me than you, or anyone else. does that actually make them more valuable than you? to me it does, to others it may not. 1 0 comment hawkinsian answered 4 years ago two points about this question: 1. this is a question for god. god says judgement is mine not because hes judgmental but because we humans are literally not capable of forming an accurate judgment of whose life is more important. theres too many factors to consider: theres infinite variables. 2. also, asking this hypothetically you can slant it any way you like (as other answerers have), and its just a hall of mirrors. if you present a real world situation, conversely, then its normally the responsibility of specific people in specific situations, and things are much more clear-cut. 1 1 comment what makes one persons life more important and valuable than anothers? sign into add your answer dee ® answered 4 years ago relationship. i do believe that every person is important. what makes one person more important and valuable to other is the relationship or connections. for example; my mother is important to me because she is my mother but she is nothing for others. i am valuable for my boss because of my job but i am nothing to those people who doesnt know me. 5 0 comment when wave.....becomes ocean answered 4 years ago everyones life is treasure in itself. if you take the responsibility for your life you can start changing it. slow will be the change, only in the course of time will you start; moving into the world of light and crystallization, but once you are crystallized you will know what real revolution is. then share your revolution with others; it has to go that way, from heart to heart. god bless 0 0 comment trance-tech answered 4 years ago easy questions, easy answer. im a strong believer in the capital punishment and i would love to see it in the uk. so what im saying is whats more important and valuable? the life of a paedophile or the life of the next victims when the paedophile is released? 5 1 comment ? answered 4 years ago the reality of it is that we are all different. how we conduct ourselves, and what we make of our lives. those who chose the right path are worth more than those who do not. weeding out the bad apples has been a problem since the beginning of time. if its not done, however, the whole bushel spoils. why they dont get that makes no sense. 0 0 comment what?

there are two: liberty (freedom of action, for example, free speech, freedom of assembly, etc.) and property rights (the right to own the fruits of ones labor). slaves cannot quit their jobs, protest, or form unions, and they also have no right to the fruit of their labor. the latter difference is often overlooked, in order to pretend that its okay to spread the wealth and ignore property rights. and why is stealing wrong? no one is hurt, no freedoms are taken away. stealing is wrong because it is a violation of property rights. so, if all human life is valuable, then how does it lose value? those who break these conditions (rights), those who steal, murder, oppress, and enslave, or advocate any political system which fails to punish such actions, are the ones who lose value. when rights are respected, life amongst humans is mutualistic. we trade voluntarily, to mutual benefit. everyone is free to act, so long as they do not infringe the rights of others. when rights are violated, human relationships become parasitic, with one party being sacrificed to the other. prominent historical examples of this are feudalism, slavery, communism, nazism, and altruistic moral systems (theocracy). once rights are ignored, life is transformed into hell. once it is decided that it is okay to sacrifice one man for the benefit of another, society descends into primitivism, into a jungle where dog eat dog is the only social rule of conduct. the men who facilitate this fall, who advocate it and/or actively push society towards the precipice, these are the men who have no value. they are parasites clamoring for the blood of the productive, on whose ability they wish to feed. a productive, intelligent, rational competent person would have nothing to gain in the type of society they advocate; he would simply become a sacrificial animal, a host. a person who seeks to destroy a free society simply to acquire a free meal can be of no value to anyone, for they threaten every condition which allows people to be of value to one another. they are destroyers, through and through, and dont deserve a single act of charity, until they redeem themselves by acknowledging individual rights -- their own and those of others. suffering as such is not a value; only man’s fight against suffering is. if you choose to help a man who suffers, do it only on the ground of his virtues, of his right to recover, of his rational record, or of the fact that he suffers unjustly; then your action is still a trade, and his virtue is the payment for your help. but to help a man who has no virtues, to help him on the ground of his suffering as such, to accept his faults, his need, as a claim-is to accept the mortgage of a zero on your values. a man who has no virtues is a hater of existence who acts on the premise of death; to help him is to sanction his evil and to support his career of destruction. be it only a penny you will not miss or a kindly smile he has not earned, a tribute to a zero is treason to life and to all those who struggle to maintain it. it is of such pennies and smiles that the desolation of your world was made. - ayn rand - source(s): objectivism 3 0 comment dr pushpinder k answered 4 years ago i think, its material or spiritual usefulness in the collective social set up. 1 0 comment 8 answers hidden ah, who gives a shyt♥ answered 4 years ago their input in society- and how much those around them value them or view them as good person. 1 0 comment samantha answered 4 years ago we are all equal but the people around us make us believe that other people are better or higner then the rest 0 0 comment ask a question usually answered within minutes! expand details details existing questions more related questions why is 1 life so much more valuable than another?
