most valuable person-sri lankan cricket team | most valuable people in life most valuable people in life lifes too short to hate online most valuable person-hollywood most valuable person-sri lankan cricketteam mehar mohammad khalilif you’re reading this, please don’t get sidetracked by the word cricket. this isn’t really about cricket and mehar mohammad khalil isn’t even a cricketer let alone sri lankan. mehar mohammad khalil is a pakistani bus driver. please allow me to give you some background on the story. similar to other sports, cricket teams play in series where one cricketing nation will host a series of games against the visiting nation (i.e. india will play 5 cricket matches in australia). in recent times though, pakistan has had trouble attracting other cricketing nations to play on pakistani ground. opposing teams feel the country to be too dangerous to play in due to continued terrorist attacks that frequent pakistan. sri lanka who is battling their own terrorism, however, has taken pakistan’s invitation on numerous occasions. they played three “one day internationals” in the month of january 2009 and returned in late february to play 2 tests. tests can last anywhere from a day to five days. the first test played between pakistan and sri lanka actually took 5 days to declare a draw. the nations met for their second test match on march 1st. this second test was vital. it was important for declaring a winner for the series. it was also important for proving that team pakistan could still play test cricket as they were absent from playing it for a year. but it was most significant because if everything went to plan at least 10 days of world class cricket would have been played in pakistan without any trouble. if everything worked out like they were supposed to, these matches could have been used as an example to show other nations that it was safe to play in pakistan. if everything worked out, the people of pakistan could have enjoyed live cricket on their grounds. of course everything doesn’t always work out like we hope them to. on march 3rd, the third day of the second test, masked gunmen ambushed the sri lankan cricket team’s bus on their arrival to the gaddaffi stadium in lahore, pakistan. grenades were thrown, bullets were sprayed and the terrorists’ initiative was to kill on sight. when all the gun chambers were emptied and all the smoke was cleared, the altercation left 6 security personnel dead and 8 players injured.how the cricket team escaped death is a miracle but i’ll let the new sri lankan cricket captain, kumar sangakkara, explain who he credits with saving their lives: “the truth is we owe our lives to the courageous mohammad khalil, the driver. i will forever be grateful to him. the tires of the bus had been shot out and he was in grave personal danger, exposed to gunfire at the front of the bus. but he was hell-bent on getting us to safety and, somehow, he got us moving again. had khalil not acted with such courage and presence of mind most of us would have been killed.”i am a logical person but i believe sometimes events happen for a reason and sometimes events do not. the terrorists’ goal was to make sure no one felt safe in pakistan and yes, they accomplished that. it is certain that no cricket will be played there for a while and it will be difficult attracting any opposing nation to the country. however the terrorists’ ultimate goal was to wipe out the sri lankan team and to the very least many believe, kidnap them. thankfully this event did not occur and the cricket team expresses gratitude to the brave pakistani security and mohammad khalil.if it hadn’t been for mohammad khalil, sri lanka would still and for a long time be in deep mourning over the loss of their cricket heroes. to an island a little over the size of west virginia, the sport of cricket is king. a country where the population is boldly defined by class, no one is too rich or poor, or young or old to take part or enjoy watching the game. for the same reasons we enjoy our basketball, baseball, football, hockey, etc in the western world, sports play a huge factor in the tiniest of countries. the business of sports may water down what make the element special but it is still very important to those that look for any means of winning in their lives. a fan makes their home team, college team, favourite team or just their favourite player an extension of themselves. when we have our losses and victories we take them as hard and enjoy them much as the players do. when our teams/players get complimented we become almost flattered. sometimes when things aren’t going so good, we need those victories and compliments. sometimes you could find yourself being an unemployed recent university graduate that invests in these extensions of yourself to get some satisfaction. it may work out and then again it probably won’t (ah, raptors).the loss of the sri lankan cricket team would have been more than demoralizing to me, to the 20 million people in sri lanka and to all cricket fans around the world. so from myself, cricket fans around the world and the country i love and hope the best for, the country that hasn’t had a lot to smile about in the past 30 years except for cricket, we would like to thank and name you, mehar mohammed khalil, as sri lankan cricket’s most valuable person. our mvp.future outlook: i believe you must accept sri lankas invitation to the country as they will express their gratitude to you like no this:like loading... related this entry was posted on march
