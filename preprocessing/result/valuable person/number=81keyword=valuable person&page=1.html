by lisa bigelow, demand media valuable employees know right from wrong. goodshoot rf/goodshoot/getty images the old saying, if you want something done, ask a busy person is never more true than in the workplace. if you have a highly valuable employee--or desire to become a highly valuable employee--understanding the attitudes that make these folks tick is a great way to improve your own skills. first and foremost, a valuable employee knows right from wrong and chooses what's right all the time, even when it's not the easy choice. when an employee shows good character, it reflects well on the company and builds trust. another valuable character trait is dependability. when you wake up in the morning and know that she's done a good job in the past and is going to do a good job today, it's valuable. usually, these employees also display diligence. this trait means that she's going to give you an honest day's work for an honest day's pay, every day, all the time. showing up everyday and trying his honest best isn't enough. truly valuable employees are proactive and multiskilled, according to realtruth.org. being proactive means that he doesn't wait to be told what to do--he figures it out in advance and solves the problem, often before it's started. these employees also tend to continually enhance their skill set by taking on additional responsibilities. whether earning a new degree or branching out into new areas, these action-oriented folks are self-directed learners who always want to increase their own value-add. related reading: behavior vs. attitude in employees a valuable employee usually works with a smile on her face. she can effectuate attitude changes in others through her persistent use of good cheer. a valuable employee who's cheerful makes the day more fun, energetic and motivating for others. contrast this attitude with a reliably hard worker who's constantly complaining or backstabbing other co-workers. a bad attitude like that reflects poorly on one person--the person who's perpetuating it. finally, valuable employees who are dedicated to their jobs, their companies and their co-workers display this dedication through working in a disciplined manner. these employees take their responsibilities seriously and realize that shoddy work has effects that reach far off the desktop. proactive, multiskilled workers who can harness this trait, along with a good attitude, honest character and a dependable and diligent nature, will find that they will quickly become among the most valued members of their workplace. references (2) real truth; ten traits of a valuable employee; james turck; january 10, 2010north orion; increase your value as an employee; kimberly bowen; oct. 7, 2010 about the author lisa bigelow is an independent writer with prior professional experience in the finance and fitness industries. she also writes a well-regarded political commentary column published in fairfield, new haven and westchester counties in the new york city metro area. photo credits goodshoot rf/goodshoot/getty images suggest an article correction have feedback?
