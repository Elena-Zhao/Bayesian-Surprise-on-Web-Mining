why do nations go to war? why do people vote? political science at fordham is organized into four subfields: political theory, comparative politics, international politics, and american politics, and a wide range of courses are offered in each subfield. the department offers degrees at the undergraduate level and participates in the masters program in elections and campaign management. undergraduate courses are offeredat both the rose hill and lincoln center campuses and political science is one of the most popularmajors for all fordhamundergraduates. all of our courses, both undergraduate and graduate, are small, allowing for considerable faculty-student interaction. a political science degree preparesthe student for several career options. many undergraduates go on to law school, a traditional career path for political science majors, but others have found careers in government agencies, news organizations, andin the private sector. still others decide to pursue graduate study in political science. an undergraduate degree also prepares students interested in a career in politics or for fordham's masters program in elections and campaign management, which provides another route to a career in politics. political science faculty also teach in the m.a. program in international political economy and development as well as elections and campaign management m.a. program. thedepartment takes pride in thequality of its instruction and the quality of faculty scholarship. in recent years, faculty members have publishedbooks with some of the most prestigious university presses,such asprinceton, michigan, chicago, oxford, rutgersand cambridge, as well as in leading journals in the discipline. numerous faculty have won prestigious awards and prizes, including several fulbrights. and the news media often interview or quote faculty membersregarding important events for those with questions about the undergraduate major, at rose hill, contact professor robert hume, or at lincoln center, contact professor susan berger. and for questions about the m.a. in elections and campaign management, contact professor costas panagopoulos. we invite you to look through the pages here to find out more about the department, the individual faculty members, forms for students, and much more. best wishes, john p. entelis, department chair site map calendarask fordham faqsjesuit education edited by: marcus holmes 2014 fordham university rose hill campus bronx, ny 10458.
