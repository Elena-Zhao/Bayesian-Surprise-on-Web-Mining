(remember this was 10 years ago!) then, immediately after kerry and bush shook hands ending their exchange for the evening, bassik pushed ads directly to targeted voters using aol. more than encouraging, the results proved bassik’s theory correct: targeting voters online will save campaigns money and truly impact the way candidates and causes are viewed.a few short years later, bassik joined jim walsh, chris massicotte, and eli kaplan in co-founding dspolitical, the nation’s leading voter targeted digital ad network exclusively for democratic campaigns and progressive causes. since those early days, dspolitical has delivered half a billion voter targeted digital ads while millions have been served to mobile phones and tablets.a demonstration of its commitment to innovation, dspolitical works tirelessly to create and unearth new techniques that help clients more effectively reach their targeted voters and, in turn, provide democrats and progressives with the technological advantage they need to win. unrivaled big data when it comes to using “big data” for voter targeted digital ads, dspolitical has an unmatched partnership with catalist, the progressive movement’s go-to voter data provider. in fact, it is this unique partnership that has enabled dspolitical to match more than 600 million browser cookies and device profiles against the catalist voter ¬file with hundreds of targetable audience segments resulting in the ability to reach more than 90% of available online advertising inventory in the united states.no other digital ad network has access to such inventory matched with catalists battle tested voter data. proudly progressive unlike many of its rivals, dspolitical is a proudly progressive company. its partners and staff are progressive. its clients are exclusively democratic and progressive. and its catalist voter data is maintained exclusively for progressive causes.that means dspolitical’s clients never have to worry that their hard-earned ad dollars are going to a “progressive” ad network propped up by shadowy republicans interests or to enhance a voter file that’s also used by republicans and tea partiers. unmatched experience founded in 2012 by political technology and campaign veterans, dspolitical’s leadership team has decades of collective experience working with democratic campaigns, progressive organizations, and in the political technology space at all levels.combine this battle-tested experience with its expansive inventory, breadth of reach, and unrivaled access to the best data and dspolitical’s voter targeted ad network is the clear choice for democrats and progressives seeking a significant advantage over the competition. the first. the best. unrivaled big data proudly progressive unmatched experience jim walsh ceo chris massicotte coo eli kaplan cso michael bassik partner erik brydges sarah coleman melissa cressey brooke cullison melanie goff jim green alyssa heard christian loggins brian mccraw kara nelson grace teng taylor keenan services combine dspolitical’s battle-tested experience with our expansive inventory, breadth of reach, and unrivaled access to the best data and our voter targeted ad network is the clear choice for democrats and progressives seeking a significant advantage over the competition. here is a selection of our various services. target voters target ad-skippers non-tv watchers target decision makers target labor union members target media insiders target healthcare consumers digital franking our clients since our founding in 2011, dspolitical has been honored to place more than half a billion voter-targeted digital and mobile ads on behalf of scores of exceptional democratic candidates and progressive causes. the following is a partial list of those candidates and causes. more clients latest news washington post: dspolitical releases “obama-quality digital tools” for down ballot races october 16, 2014: this week the washington post shared the story of maine state representative henry beck and how he’s using democraticads.com to target voters in his campaign for reelection. the piece notes, “beck has been using digital technology that was once only available to campaigns with million-dollar budgets: online advertisements that target voters based on their web read more inventory problems?
