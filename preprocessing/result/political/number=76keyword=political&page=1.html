2005; substantive revision mon sep 19, 2011for thomas aquinas, as for aristotle, doing moral philosophy isthinking as generally as possible about what i should choose to do(and not to do), considering my whole life as a field ofopportunity (or misuse of opportunity). thinking as general as thisconcerns not merely my own opportunities, but the kinds ofgood things that any human being can do and achieve, or be deprived of.thinking about what to do is conveniently labeledpractical, and is concerned with what and how to chooseand do what one intelligently and reasonably can (i) to achieveintelligible goods in one's own life and the lives of other humanbeings and their environment, and (ii) to be of good character and livea life that as a whole will have been a reasonable response to suchopportunities.political philosophy is, in one respect, simply that part orextension of moral philosophy which considers the kinds of choice thatshould be made by all who share in the responsibility and authority ofchoosing for a community of the comprehensive kind called political. inanother respect, it is a systematic explanatory account of the forms ofpolitical arrangement that experience and empirical observation showare available, with their characteristic features, outcomes, andadvantages (and disadvantages and bad aspects and consequences). thoughin form descriptive and contemplative, and thus non-practical, thisaspect of political philosophy remains subordinate, in itssystematization or conceptual structure, to the categories one findsnecessary or appropriate when doing moral and political philosophy asit should be done, that is, as practical thinking by one whose everychoice (even the choice to do nothing now, or the choice do moral orpolitical philosophy) should be a good use of opportunity.moral and political philosophy for aquinas, then, is (1) the set orsets of concepts and propositions which, as principles and precepts ofaction, pick out the kinds of chosen action that are truly intelligentand reasonable for human individuals and political communities,together with (2) the arguments necessary to justify those concepts andpropositions in the face of doubts, or at least to defend them againstobjections. it is a fundamentally practical philosophy ofprinciples which direct us towards human fulfillmentso far as that happier state of affairs is both constituted andachievable by way of the actions that both manifest and build up theexcellences of character traditionally called virtues. if onemust use a post-kantian jargon, it is both teleologicaland deontic, and not more the one than the other.1. interpretations and method 1.1 is the notion of distinctive human function foundational for aquinas? 1.2 is the identification of man's

and methodaquinas' moral and political philosophy has to be reconstructed fromhis theological treatises and commentaries and his commentaries onaristotle's nicomachean ethics and the first two and halfbooks of aristotle's politics. its proper interpretation hasbeen a matter of some difficulty from the time of his death in1274. in recent decades the way to understand some aspects of itsfoundational concepts and logic has been strenuously disputed, notleast among those philosophers who see it as offering a broadly soundanswer to radical scepticism about value and obligation, an answertruer and more human than kant's or bentham's or their (in thebroadest sense) successors'. a partial sample of these controversiesis given in 1.1 and 1.2 below, which state the more commoninterpretation on two strategic issues and then elaborate objectionsto those interpretations. the remainder of this article then proceedson the basis that there is merit in these objections, and that thestudy of aquinas' ethics as a systematic and strictly philosophicalwork of practical reason (at its most general and reflective) is stillin its infancy. further textual support, from over 60 of aquinas'works, can be found in finnis 1998. criticisms of the interpretationof aquinas' theory that is proposed in that work can be found in long2004, and earlier in lisska 1998 and mcinerny 1997. these works arguein various ways that that interpretation denies or neglects themetaphysical foundations of the principles of practical reason that itoffers to identify. the first issue underlying this debate is whetherthe order of inquiry and coming to know (the epistemological order) isthe same as the order of metaphysical dependence. the second issue iswhether we can settle the first issue by using the epistemologicalaxiom that we come to an (ultimately metaphysical) understanding ofdynamic natures by understanding capacities through their actuations which, in turn, we come to understand by understanding theirobjects. does or does not that axiom entail that understanding ofobjects such as the intelligible goods (the objects of acts of will)precedes an adequate knowledge of nature, notwithstanding that (as isagreed on all sides) in the metaphysical order of intrinsic dependencesuch objects could not be willed or attained but for the given natureof (in this case) the human person?1.1 is the notion of distinctive human function foundational for aquinas?one line of understanding is exemplified by the section onmoral doctrine in mcinerny and o'callaghan 2005. itgives a priority to aristotle's arguments attempting to identifya distinctive or peculiarly humanfunction, arguments which proceed on the postulate that, if eachkind of craft has its own characteristic function and mode ofoperation, so must human life as a whole have an overalland distinctively characteristic function andoperatio; and the determination of this should decisivelyshape the whole of (the rest of) ethics and political theory. to thisstandard interpretation other interpreters, such as grisez, finnis, andrhonheimer, object on grounds such as these:(i) aquinas' austerely self-disciplined purposes as anaristotelian commentator make quite insecure any assumptionthat he treats as fundamental to his own thinking any and everyproposition which is treated by aristotle as fundamental and expoundedin aquinas' relevant commentary without adverse comment.(ii) the distinctive function argument is notprominent or adduced as fundamental (or at all) in aquinas' morefree-standing treatments of morality.(iii) the argument is treated by aquinas' commentary asyielding the conclusion that felicitas (human happiness orflourishing) consists in a complete life lived in accordance withreason and hence, by entailment, with virtue. but in the summatheologiae this is argued to be only an imperfect and incompletefelicitas, and the problematic character of such a concept isapparent from the summa's definition offelicitas (and synonymously beatitudo) as perfectgood and complete satisfaction of all desires.(iv) the distinctive function argument is inherentlyunsatisfying in ways that could hardly have failed to be apparent to soable a philosopher as aquinas. (a) in aquinas' rendering, itdepends on the postulate that nature does nothing invain, which in turn depends, according to aquinas, on thepremise that nature is the product of divine creative rationality, apremise which aquinas himself argues is, though provable, by no meansself-evident. (b) it seems arbitrary to assume that, if there is anappropriate function or operatio of human beings, it must bepeculiar to them. for peculiarity or distinctiveness has no inherentrelationship to practical fittingness, and in fact aquinas elsewheredenies that rationality is peculiar to human beings since he holds thatthere are other intelligent creatures (the angels, understood to becreated minds unmixed with matter, occupying what would otherwise be asurprising gap in the hierarchy of beings which ascends from the mostmaterial and inactive kinds through the vegetative kinds, the animalkinds, and the rational animal humankind, to the one utterly active andintelligent, non-dependent and uncreated divine being).(v) the root of the weakness of the peculiar/distinctivefunction argument is that it is looking in the wrong direction,towards a metaphysical proposition concerning the nature of things,instead of towards what is intelligibly good as an opportunity, perhapseven the supreme opportunity, for me and anyone like me (any humanbeing). and it is a truly fundamental methodological axiom ofaquinas's philosophy, from beginning to end of his works, that incoming to understand the nature of a dynamic reality such as humanbeing, one must first understand its capacities, to understand whichone must first understand its act(ivities), to understand which onemust first come to understand those activities' objects. but theobjects of human activities are intelligible opportunities such ascoming to know, being alive and healthy, being in friendship withothers, and so forth objects whose attractiveness, fittingness,opportuneness, or appropriateness is in no way dependent upon, or evenmuch enhanced by, the thought that they are distinctivelycharacteristic of human beings as opposed to other animals.(vi) the fact that an operatio is distinctive of humanbeings does not entail that that operatio is truly valuable,still less that it is obligatory, or that it is more valuable thanalternative and incompatible ways or objectives of acting. for apremise containing no evaluative or normative term cannot entail aconclusion including such a term. if, on the other hand, the postulatethat a certain operatio is the proper (or even a proper)function of human beings is asserted to be itself evaluative and/ornormative rather than, or as well as, factual/descriptive, then someaccount is needed of the postulate's source or justification (orself-evidence?). aquinas has a fairly careful account of theself-evidence of a number of foundational evaluative and normativeprinciples, but only one or two of them are said by him to point tokinds of operatio distinctive of human beings; two of thefoundational principles are explicitly said by him to direct to goodsthat are not peculiar to human beings.(vii) the analogy comparing one's life as a whole to arts andcrafts, each with its own distinctive function, operatio,seems weak, questionable and indeed question-begging. for life as awhole is open-ended both in having no knowable duration (see 2.2.below) and in requiring judgment about the choice-worthiness of ends aswell as means and techniques (see 4.4.1. below). moreover, aquinas likearistotle regularly insists on the irreducibility of the distinction ordistinctions between, on the one hand, ars or factio(arts, crafts, techniques) and actio (the precisesubject-matter of morality and morally significant choices).1.2 is the identification of man's last end foundational for aquinas?along with very many other thomistic commentators, mcinerny ando'callaghan 2005 and celano 2003 treat aquinas' moralphilosophy as founded, like his moral theology, upon his determinationof what felicitas (= perfecta beatitudo andaristotle's eudaimonia) truly is, a determination madein the opening quaestiones of the second part of his summatheologiae, where he elaborately argues that completebeatitudo or felicitas consists in an uninterruptiblevision of god (and, in god, of the other truths we naturally desire toknow), something possible for us only in a life in manyrespects another life after death. but it ispossible to regard aquinas' argument in thosequaestiones as dictated by the needs of a specificallytheological pedagogy, as open to telling objections, and as detachablefrom (or at least as methodologically posterior to) the working andsound foundations of his moral philosophy and his treatment of specificmoral issues detachable, that is to say, in a way that aquinaswould not need to regard as inappropriate in the different context oftoday's discourse. this article will treat aquinas' ethicsand political theory as detachable from his theology of life'sultimate point, and will take seriously his emphatic and reiteratedthesis that, apart from the divinely given and super-naturalopportunity of perfecta beatitudo (a gift about whichphilosophy as such knows nothing), the only ultimate end andbeatitudo (fulfillment) for human beings is living ina completely reasonable, morally excellent (virtuosus) way.that thesis entails that philosophy's main account ofmorality need and should contain no claim about what perfect happinessconsists in.despite surface appearances, aquinas is conscious ofaristotle's failure to settle whether it is contemplation orpolitical praxis that is the essence of human fulfillment. hetherefore attempts, more intently than aristotle did in any survivingwork, to identify what the first principles of ethics and politics are,and to do so without any premises or presuppositions about a unitarylast end of human existence.moreover, when aquinas does refer to beatitudo asfundamental to identifying the principles of practical reason and thenatural (because reasonable) moral law, he in the same breathemphasizes that this is not to be thought of as the happiness of thedeliberating and acting individual alone, but rather as thecommon flourishing of the community, ultimately the wholecommunity of humankind:the ultimate end of human life is felicitas orbeatitudo so the main concern of law [including thenatural (moral) law] must be with directing towards beatitudo.again, since every part stands to the whole as incomplete stands tocomplete, and individual human beings are each parts of a completecommunity, law's appropriate concern is necessarily withdirecting towards common felicitas that is, tocommon good. (st i-ii q. 90 a. 2.)the complete community mentioned here is the politicalcommunity, with its laws, but the proposition implicitly refers also tothe community of all rational creatures, to whose common good morality(the moral law) directs us.1.2.1 philosophy and theology in aquinas' theory of morality and politicsdetaching aquinas' philosophy from his theology is compatiblewith distinctions he firmly delineates at the beginning of his twomature theological syntheses, the summa contra gentiles andthe summa theologiae. (i) there are truths, he says, which areaccessible to natural reason, that is, to ordinary experience(including the specialized observations of natural scientists),insight, and reflection; and these include practical truths about goodand evil, right and wrong. (ii) many of those truths of natural reasonare confirmed, and even clarified, by divine revelation, that is, thepropositions communicated directly or inferentially in the life andworks of christ, as transmitted by his immediate followers and preparedfor in the jewish scriptures accepted by those followers as revelatory.(iii) some of the truths divinely revealed could not have beendiscovered by natural, philosophical reason, even though, onceaccepted, their content and significance can be illuminated by thephilosophically ordered reflection which he calls theology.the philosophical positions in ethics and politics (including law)that are explored in this article belong to categories (i) and (ii).the moral and political norms stated, for example, in the biblicaldecalogue are, in aquinas' view, all knowable independently ofthat revelation, which confirms and perhaps clarifies them. but thepropositions that he holds about what the true last end or ultimatedestiny of human beings actually is belong to category (iii) and cannotbe affirmed on any philosophical basis, even though philosophy, hethinks, can demonstrate that they are neither incoherent nor contraryto any proposition which philosophy shows must be affirmed.2. practical reason's first principlesintelligence and reason are not two powers; reason andreasoning in a narrow sense can be regarded as theextension of one's intelligence (one'scapacity for intelligent insight into the data of experience) into thepropositional work of reasoning towards judgment, andreason (ratio) in a broader sense refers tothis whole capacity, only analytically divisible into aspects orphases. so too, practical reason is not a distinct power. rather,one's capacity to think about the way things are can be(and naturally, that is effortlessly and normally, is)extended (aquinas' metaphor) to thinkingintelligently and making reasonable and true judgments about whatto do. thinking and judging of the latter kind is practical, thatis, intends to terminate in choice and action (in greekpraxis, in latin actio). practicalreason sometimes refers (i) directly to such thinking,sometimes (ii) to the propositional content or structure which suchthinking has when it is done well and thus to the propositionsthat pick out what kinds of action one ought to be judgingpursuit-worthy, undesirable, right, wrong, etc. and sometimes(iii) to the capacity to engage in such thinking by understanding such propositions andbeing guided by them.2.1 precondition: capacity for self-determination by free choicespractical reason's central activity is deliberation about whatto do. one would have no need to deliberate unless one were confrontedby alternative attractive possibilities for action (kinds ofopportunity) between which one must choose (in the sense that onecannot do both at the same time, if at all) and can choose. thestandards that one comes to understand to be the appropriate guides forone's deliberation, choice and action give such guidance, not bypredicting what one will do, but by directing what one shoulddo. (the should here may but need not be moral.) therecould be no normativity, no practical (choice-guiding) directiveness,unless free choices were really possible.aquinas's position is not that all our activities are freelychosen: there are indeed acts of the human person,perhaps quite frequent, which are not human acts in thecentral sense (freely chosen) but rather spontaneous and undeliberated.nor is it that chosen acts must be immediately preceded by choice: manyof one's acts are the carrying out of choices which were made inthe past and need not be now renewed or repeated since no alternativeoption appears attractive. it is that one can be and often is in such aposition that, confronted by two or more attractive possibilities(including perhaps the option of doing nothing), there isnothing either within or outside one's personal constitution thatdetermines (settles) one's choice, other than the choosing:mal. q. 6. this conception of free choice (liberumarbitrium or libera electio) is much stronger thanaristotle's, on whose conception free choices are free only fromexternal determining factors. aquinas' conception offree choice is also incompatible with modern notions of softdeterminism, or the supposed compatibility of human responsibility (andof the sense [self-understanding] that one is freely choosing)with determination of every event by laws (e.g. physical) of nature.aquinas understands the freedom of our free choices to be a reality asprimary and metaphysically and conceptually irreducible as the realityof physical laws, and he puts all his reflections on morality andpractical reason under the heading of mastery over one'sown acts (st i-ii, prologue).he is also insistent that if there were no such freedom andself-determination, there could be no responsibility (fault, merit,etc.), and no sense or content to any ought (normativity)such as ethics is concerned with.2.1.1 choice, intention and act-descriptionsaquinas pulls together into a powerful (though confusinglyexpounded) synthesis a long tradition of analysis of the elements ofunderstanding (reason) and intelligent response (will) that constitutedeliberation, choice, and execution of choice: st i-ii qq.617. the analysis shows the centrality of intention in the assessmentof options and actions. in a narrow sense of the word,intention is always of ends and choice is of means;but since every means (save the means most proximate to sheer trying orexertion) is also an end relative to a more proximate means, what ischosen when one adopts one of two or more proposals (for one'saction) that one has shaped in one's deliberation is rightly,though more broadly, said to be what one intends, what one doesintentionally or with intent(ion), and so forth. an act(ion) isparadigmatically what it is intended to be; that is, its morallyprimary description prior to any moral evaluation or predicate is the description it had in the deliberation by which one shapedthe proposal to act thus. aquinas' way of saying thisis: acts are specified by have their specific characterfrom their objects, where objects has the focalmeaning of proximate end as envisaged by the deliberating and actingperson. of course, the behavior involved in that act can be given otherdescriptions in the light of conventions of description, orexpectations and responsibilities, and so forth, and one or other thesedescriptions may be given priority by law, custom, or some otherspecial interest or perspective. but it is primarily on actsqua intended, or on the acts (e.g. of taking care) that oneought to have intended, that ethical standards (moral principles andprecepts) bear. to repeat: in the preceding sentenceintended is used in the broad sense; aquinas sometimesemploys it this way (e.g. st ii-ii q. 64 a. 7), though in hisofficial synthesis the word is used in the narrower sense to signifythe (further) intention with which the act's object waschosen object being the most proximate of one's (broadsense) intentions.this understanding of human action has often been misappropriated byinterpreters who have assumed that when aquinas says that acts arewrongful by reason of their undue matter (indebitamateria), he refers to an item of behavior specifiable by itsphysical characteristics and causal structure. so, for example,direct killing of the innocent is taken to refer tobehavior whose causally immediate effect is killing, or which has itslethal effect before it has its intended good effect. but this isincompatible with aquinas' fundamental and consistent positionsabout human action. the matter of a morally significantact is, for him, its immediate object under the description it has inone's deliberation: mal. q. 7 a. 1; q. 2 a. 4 ad 5; a.6; a. 7 ad 8. it is, in other words, not an item of behavior considered in its observable physicality as such, but rather one'sbehavior as one's objective (or the most proximate of one'sobjectives), that is, as one envisages it, adopts it by choice, andcauses it by one's effort to do so. the most objective account ofhuman action is provided by the account that is most subjective. thissound account will, however, set aside any distorted act-descriptionsthat one may offer others, or even oneself, as rationalizations andexculpations of one's choice and act, but that do not correspondto what really made the option attractive, as end or as means, and sowas treated, in one's actual course of deliberation, asone's reason for acting as one did. the immediately and foreseenlethal effect of an act of self-defense may genuinely be a side-effectof one's choosing to stop the attack by the only availableefficacious means (st ii-ii q. 64 a. 7), or it may beone's precise object (and the matter of one'schoice and act) because one's (further) intent was to take lethalrevenge on an old enemy, or to deter potential assailants by theprospect of their death, or to win a reward. behaviorally identicalitems of behavior may thus be very different human acts, discernibleonly by knowing the acting person's reasons for acting.2.2 context: the open horizon of human life as a wholeethical standards, for which practical reason's firstprinciples provide the foundations or sources, concern actions aschoosable and self-determining. they are thus to be distinguishedclearly, as aristotle already emphasized, from standards which arepractical, rational, and normative in a different way, namely thetechnical or technological standards internal to every art, craft, orother system for mastering matter. aquinas locates the significant andirreducible difference between ethics and all these forms ofart in three features: (i) moral thought, even when mostunselfishly concerned with helping others through the good effects ofphysical effort and causality, is fundamentally concerned with theproblem of bringing order into one's own will, action, andcharacter, rather than the problem of how to bring order into the worldbeyond one's will. (ii) correspondingly, the effects of morallysignificant free choices (good or evil) are in the first instanceintransitive (effects on the will and character of the acting person.only secondarily are they transitive effects on the world, even whenthat person's intentions are focused, as they normally should be,on the benefits of those external effects. (iii) whereas every art andtechnique has a more or less limited objective (end) which can beaccomplished by skillful deployment of the art, moral thought has inview an unlimited and common (shared) horizon or point, that ofhuman life as a whole [finis communis totius humanaevitae] (st i-ii q. 21 a. 2 ad 2), for each ofone's morally significant choices (for good or evil) is a choiceto devote a part of one's single life to a purpose which couldhave been any of the whole open-ended range of purposes open to humanpursuit for the sake of benefiting all or any human being(s).2.3 at the origin of oughtpractical reason, in aquinas' view, has both one absolutelyfirst principle and many truly first principles: st i-ii q. 94a. 2. the absolutely first principle is formal and in a sensecontentless. like the logical principle of non-contradiction whichcontrols all rational thought, it expresses, one might say, thepressure of reason and is so far from being empty of significance andforce that its form may be regarded as the frame, and its normativitythe source, for all the normativity of the substantive first principlesand of the moral principles which are inferable from them. aquinasarticulates it as good is to be done and pursued, and badavoided (ibid.).this has often been truncated to (i) good is to be done, andevil avoided or even, more drastically, (iia) do good andavoid evil or yet more drastically (iib) avoid evil andseek the good. but grisez 1963 gave reason to think theseabbreviations both exegetically and philosophically unsound. the firstpractical principle is not a command or imperative as (ii) would haveit, nor is it a moral principle as all these formulae suggest byomitting to be pursued (see 2.7 below). both in grammarand in propositional content, the principle's gerundiveis-to-be is neither imperative nor predictive, butrationally directive an ought in the way that getsits fully developed and central sense and normativity in the morespecified ought of moral standards.against a kantian or neo-kantian primacy or ultimacy ofstructures of mind, aquinas would say that just as thepressure of reason articulated in the principle of non-contradictionhas its source in the structure of reality in the realopposition between being and not being so thesource of the equivalently first practical principle is the realdesirability of intelligible goods, and the trueundesirability of what is not good.2.4 first principles of practical reasonif plato and aristotle fail to articulate substantive firstprinciples of practical reason, and if kant overlooks them in favor ofthe quasi-humeian notions of motivation that dominate ethics during theenlightenment (and ever since), the articulation of such principles byaquinas deserves attention.2.4.1 first principles are insights into the data of experience and understood possibilityeach of the several substantive first principles of practical reasonpicks out and directs one towards a distinct intelligible good which,in line with the primariness of the principle identifying it, can becalled basic (not a term used by aquinas). aquinasregards each of the first practical principles as self-evident (perse notum: known through itself) and undeduced (primum andindemonstrabile). he does not, however, mean that they aredata-less intuitions; even the indemonstrable firstprinciples in any field of human knowledge are knowable only by insight(intellectus) into data of experience (here, of causality andinclination).moreover, when describing the first practical principles asself-evident, aquinas emphasises that self-evidence is relative: whatis not obvious to some will be self-evident to those who have moreample experience and a better understanding of other aspects of thematter. and we should expect our understanding of first principles togrow as we come to understand more about the objects to which theyrefer and direct (e.g. knowledge, human life, marriage, etc.).2.4.2 their oughts are not inferred from any isaquinas's repeated affirmation that practical reason'sfirst principles are undeduced refutes the common accusation orassumption that his ethics invalidly attempts to deduce or inferought from is, for his affirmation entails that thesources of all relevant oughts cannot be deduced from anyis. there remain, however, a number of contemporary thomistswho deny that such a deduction or inference need be fallacious, andregard aquinas as postulating some such deduction or inference. theyare challenged., however, by others (such as rhonheimer, boyle, andfinnis) who, while sharing the view that his ethics is in theserespects fundamentally sound, deny that aquinas attempted or postulatedany such deduction or inference, and ask for some demonstration (i)that he did and (ii) that he or anyone else could make such a deductionor inference.these critics reinforce their denial by pointing out that in hisprologue to his commentary on aristotle's ethics,aquinas teaches that knowledge of things that are what they areindependently of our thought (i.e. of nature) is fundamentally distinctboth from logic and from practical knowledge, one of whose two speciesis philosophia moralis (whose first principles or fundamentaloughts are under discussion here)2.4.3 a sample first principle: knowledge is pursuit-worthyaquinas neglects to spell out how these first principles come to beunderstood. but he holds that they are understood and accepted byeveryone who has enough experience to understand their terms. theprocess of coming to understand a first practical principle may beexemplified as follows, in relation to the basic good of knowledge. asa child one experiences the inclination to ask questions, and to greetapparently satisfactory answers with satisfaction and failure to answeras a disappointment. at some point one comes to understand has theinsight that such answers are instances of a quite general standingpossibility, namely knowledge, coming to know and overcoming ignorance.by a distinct though often well nigh simultaneous further insight onecomes to understand that this knowledge is not merely apossibility but also a good [bonum], that is to sayan opportunity, a benefit, something desirable as akind of improvement (a perfectio) of one's oranyone's condition, and as to be pursued.2.5 the other basic goodsthe basic human goods which first practical principles identify anddirect us to are identified by aquinas as (i) life, (ii)marriage between man and woman and bringing up of children[coniunctio maris et feminae et educatio liberorum](not at all reducible to procreation), (iii) knowledge,(iv) living in fellowship (societas and amicitia)with others, (v) practical reasonableness (bonum rationis)itself, and (vi) knowing and relating appropriately to thetranscendent cause of all being, value, normativity and efficaciousaction (st i-ii q. 94 aa. 2 3). his lists are alwaysexplicitly open-ended. they sketch the outlines and elements of theflourishing of the human persons in whom they can be actualized. evencomplete fulfillment the beatitudo perfecta thataquinas places firmly outside our natural capacities and this mortallife could not be regarded as a further good, but rather as asynthesis and heightened actualization of these basic goods in themanner appropriate to a form of life free from both immaturity (andother incidents of procreation) and decay.similarly, as is entailed by the epistemological principle thatnature is known by capacities, capacities by acts, and acts by theirobjects (see 1.1(v) above), these basic goods, being the basic objectsof will and free action, are the outline of human nature. theis of an adequate account of human nature is dependent uponprior grasp of the oughts of practical reason's first,good-identifying principles, even though that prior grasp was madepossible by that partial understanding of human nature which comes withan understanding of certain lines of causality and possibility. butdefending the epistemological priority of the intelligible objects ofwill in explanations of practical reason does not entail (contrast mcinerny1992) any denial of the metaphysical priority of the naturally givenfacts about the human makeup.2.6 known by (or from) inclination?many modern accounts of aquinas' theory of natural law giveexplanatory primacy to the naturalness of the inclinations (to live, toknow, etc.) that correspond to these basic goods. but others regardthis as a fundamental misunderstanding of aquinas' conception ofwill, and of the epistemological relationship between nature andreason. will is for him intelligent response to intelligible good:one's will is in one's reason [voluntasin ratione]. he makes it very explicit both that human actions arerightly said to be natural (in the morally relevant sense ofnatural) when and because they are intelligent andreasonable (st i-ii q. 71 a. 2), and that there areinclinations which are natural, in the sense that they are commonlyfound or characterize some or even most individuals, yet are unnaturalbecause lacking any intelligibly good object. so explanatory prioritymust be accorded to the basic human goods themselves, and to theself-evident desirability which makes each of them the object of aninclination in the will of anyone sufficiently intelligent and matureto understand their goodness (that is, the way they make human beingsmore fulfilled, more perfect [complete]). an inclinationof that kind is relevant in practical reason because its object isdesirable, and desirable because it would contribute to anyone'sflourishing. to say this is not to say that our natural inclinations towhat contributes to our flourishing are mere accident or happenstance.2.7 only incipiently moralmany nineteenth- and early twentieth century accounts of aquinastook it that the first principles of practical reason, which heregularly calls first principles of natural law or natural right, aremoral principles picking out kinds of human act as to be done (e.g.alms-giving to the poor) or not done (e.g. murder, adultery), in themanner of the commandments. but though there are a few passages inwhich aquinas himself speaks in that way, they can be read down so asto make them consistent with the more strategic passages in which hespeaks of such moral principles or norms as derivedconclusions from first principles. (see also 3.3 below.) even immoralpeople so blinded by culture or disposition that they do not make theseinferences nevertheless can and normally do understand thefirst principles of practical reason and are guided by them,though imperfectly, in their deliberations.against kant's assumption that, since the ends toward whichone wishes to act are subjective because projected (as hume proposed) byone's subrational desires, practical reason's function isto limit and channel one's pursuit of those ends, aquinasconsiders that practical reason's first and fundamental operationis not limiting, confining or negative but rather facilitating andpositive: finding and constructing intelligible ends to be pursued(prosequenda), ends that give intelligent point to ourbehavior.the thesis that the first practical principles are only incipientlymoral should not be confused with the widespread modern opinion thatpractical reason's default position is self-interest orprudential reason, so that there is a puzzle about howone transits from this to morality. in aquinas' classical view,one's reason (as distinct from some of one's customary ways of thinking)naturally understands the primary or basic goods as good for anyone,and further understands that it is good to participate in the manyforms of friendship which require that one set aside all merelyemotionally motivated self-preference.3. moral principlesthe discerning, inferring and elaborating of moral principles is atask for practical reasonableness. the judgments one makes in doingthis are together called one's conscience, in a senseprior to the sense in which conscience is the judgments one passes orcould pass on one's own acts considered retrospectively. someonewhose conscience is sound has in place the basic elements of soundjudgment and practical reasonableness, that is of the intellectual andmoral virtue which aquinas calls prudentia. fullprudentia requires that one put one's sound judgmentinto effect all the way down, i.e. into the particulars of choice andaction in the face of temptations to unreasonable but perhaps notunintelligent alternatives.3.1 conscienceconscience in aquinas' view is not a special power or presencewithin us, but is our practical intelligence at work, primarily in theform of a stock of judgments about the reasonableness (rightness) orunreasonableness (wrongness) of kinds of action (kinds of option).since each such judgment is of the form [it is true that] actionof the kind phi is always [or generally] wrong [or: isgenerally to be done, etc.] or phi is [always][or: generally] required [or forbidden] by reason, it must bethe case as aquinas stresses very forcefully thatone's conscience is binding upon oneself even when it is utterlymistaken and directs or licenses awful misdeeds. for since it islogically impossible that one could be aware that one's presentjudgment of conscience is mistaken, setting oneself against one'sown firm judgment of conscience is setting oneself against the goods oftruth and reasonableness, and that cannot fail to be wrong: sti-ii q. 19 a. 5; ver. q. 17 a. 4. the fact that, if one hasformed one's judgment corruptly, one will also be acting wronglyif one follows it (st i-ii q. 19 a. 6) does not affect theobligatoriness (for oneself) of one's conscience. this teachingabout conscience was rather novel in his day and to this day is oftenmisrepresented or misapplied as a kind of relativism or subjectivism.but it is actually an implication of aquinas' clarity about theimplications of regarding moral judgments as true (or false)and of thus rejecting subjectivism and relativism.3.2 the supreme moral principleaquinas is regrettably inexplicit about how the first practicalprinciples yield moral principles, precepts or rules that have thecombined generality and specificity of the precepts found in theportion of the biblical decalogue (exod. 20.117;deut. 5.621) traditionally called moral (the last sevenprecepts, e.g. parents should be reverenced, murder is wrong, adulteryis wrong, etc.). but a reconstruction of his scattered statements makesit clear enough that in his view a first implication of the array offirst principles, each directing us to goods actualisable as much inothers as in oneself, is this: that one should love one'sneighbor as oneself.since he considers this principle, like the set of first principlesmentioned in i-ii q. 94 a. 2, to be self-evident (per senotum), he must regard the principle of love-of-neighbor-as-selfnot so much as an inference from, or even specification of, but rathera redescriptive summary of that set. this in turn suggests the furtherreflection that the first principles, and the goods (bona) towhich they direct us, are transparent, so to speak, for theflesh-and-blood persons in whom they are and can be instantiated.moreover, it may be thought that the primary moral principle of love ofneighbor as oneself is another reason to doubt (despite appearances)the strategic role of eudemonism in his ethics. aristotelianisinginterpretations of aquinas' ethics normally make central thenotion of fulfillment, understood (it seems) as the fulfillment of thedeliberating and acting person to which the requirement ofneighbor love does not have a perspicuous relationship. grisez andothers, on the other hand, take it that the role of fulfillment(eudaimonia, beatitudo) in ethical thought's unfoldingfrom the first principles of practical reason is best captured by amaster moral principle close though perhaps not identicalto aquinas's supreme moral principle: that all one's actsof will be open to integral human fulfillment, that is to thefulfillment of all human persons and communities now and in future.the supreme moral principle of love of neighbor as self has, aquinasthinks, an immediately proximate specification in the golden rule:others are to be treated by me as i would wish them to treat me. thetight relation between the love principle and the golden rule suggeststhat love and justice, though analytically distinguishable, certainlycannot be contrasted as other and other. neighborexcludes no human being anywhere, insofar as anyone could be benefitedby one's choices and actions. to love someone is essentially towill that person's good. the reasonable priorities among allthese persons as objects of one's love, goodwill and care arediscussed by aquinas both as an order of love(s)[ordo amoris] and as a matter of right and justice.3.2.1 the fuller version: the place of the transcendentsince aquinas thinks that the existence and providence of god, asthe transcendent source of all persons and benefits, is certain, hisusual statement of the master moral principle affirms that one shouldlove god and one's-neighbor-as-oneself. but since he accepts thatthe existence of god is not self-evident, he can allow that the morestrictly self-evident form of the master moral principle refers only tolove of human persons (self and neighbors). he would add that, once theexistence and nature of god is accepted, as it philosophically shouldbe, the rational requirement of loving god, and thus the fuller versionof the master moral principle, is self-evident. he also holds that onedoes not offend against this requirement of loving god except by makingchoices contrary to human good, that is, to love of self or neighbor:scg iii c. 122 n. 2.3.3 moral precepts are further specifications of this master principle and its immediate specificationsall moral principles and norms, aquinas thinks, can be inferred as either implicit in, or referable to as conclusionsfrom the moral first principle of love of neighbor as self:st i-ii q. 99 a. 1 ad 2 with q. 91 a. 4c and q. 100 a. 2 ad 2;q. 100 aa. 3 and 11c. but he never displays an example or schema ofthese deduction-like inferences. consequently, as noted in 2.7 above,his would-be successors have sometimes proposed that moral principlesand norms have the self-evidence of first principles, and sometimes,equally desperately, have offered premises which, though suggested bysome of aquinas's argumentation or remarks, are incoherent withhis general theory e.g. that natural functions are not to befrustrated.the main lines of aquinas' theory of moral principles stronglysuggest that moral norms (precepts, standards) are specifications ofgood is to be done and pursued, and evil avoided,specifications which so direct choice and action that each of theprimary goods (elements of human fulfillment) will be respected andpromoted to the extent required by the good of practical reasonableness(bonum rationis). and what practical reasonableness requiresseems to be that each of the basic human goods be treated as what ittruly is: a basic reason for action amongst other basic reasons whoseintegral directiveness is not to be cut down or deflected bysubrational passions. the principle of love of neighbor as self and thegolden rule immediately pick out one element in that integraldirectiveness. the other framework moral rules give moral direction bystating ways in which more or less specific types of choiceare immediately or mediately contrary to some basic good. this appearsto be aquinas's implicit method, as illustrated below (3.4).an adequate exposition and defence of the moral norms upheld byaquinas requires a critique, only hints for which can be found in hiswork, of theories which claim that choice can and should rationally beguided by a utilitarian, consequentialist or proportionalist masterprinciple calling for maximizing of overall net good (or, some say,incompatibly, for minimizing net evils). in developments ofaquinas's moral theory such as are proposed by grisez and finnis,that critique is treated as an indispensable preliminary to anyreflective non-question-begging identification of the route from firstprinciples to specific moral norms.3.4 some examplesthe three examples or sets of examples considered in this sectionare only examples of the kinds of moral norms (praecepta)which aquinas considers are excluded by any sound conscience fromone's deliberations about what to choose. other examples are morecomplex, such as theft and various other wrongful deprivations ofproperty, and the form of charging for loans which is named usury andjudged by aquinas (not implausibly, though with little directapplicability to developed financial markets: see finnis 1998, 204210)to be always contrary to just equality. aquinas also treats in somedetail scores, indeed hundreds of other moral issues, touching the lifeof judges, advocates, merchants, the rich, the poor, or everyone.3.4.1 homicidesome types of act are intrinsically and immediately contrary to thebasic human good of life, that is to a human being's very being.every act which is intended, whether as end or as means, to kill aninnocent human being, and every act done by a private person which isintended to kill any human being, is to be excluded fromdeliberation as wrongful because contrary to love of neighbor as self(or self as neighbor). public persons, aquinas thinks, can rightfullyintend to kill in carrying out needful acts of war, suppression ofserious wrongdoing, and punishment (see also 6.3 below).as a private person one may rightfully use force in defense ofoneself or others even if the force is such that one foresees it islikely or even certain to kill; but one's intention in using suchlethal force must not be to kill, but only to disable and block theattack (and less lethal force would not have met the need for defensiveblocking of the assault). aquinas' discussion of this(st ii-ii q. 64 a.7) is the locus classicus for what laterbecame known, unhappily, as the principle of doubleeffect, whose real core is the thought that moral principles beardifferently on kinds of action specified by intention (e.g. tokill) from the way they bear on behavior chosen with foresightthat it will (probably or even certainly) kill as aside-effect (praeter intentionem outside theacting person's intention).aquinas wavers between suggesting that the use of lethal publicforce, e.g. in capital punishment, intends (is referredto) justice rather than killing, and plainly accepting that insuch cases death is indeed intended. the latter is his dominantposition; his arguments to justify a kind of choice which, whatever itsbeneficial consequences, is so immediately against the good of lifehave come increasingly to seem insufficient: the catechism of thecatholic church (1993), paras. 226367 expounds its whole teachingon war, lethal police action, and capital punishment on the basis ofthe thought that these can be justified only so far as they amount tocausing death as a side-effect, and not as killing with intent to kill.the thought is formulated by appeal to aquinas' reference to actswith double effect in his discussion of privatedefence in st ii-ii q. 64 a. 7.3.4.2 adultery and other kinds of act contrary to the good of marriagemarriage is, aquinas says, a primary human good and, philosophicallyconsidered, it has a dual point (end, finis): (i) theprocreation and bringing up of children is a manner suited to theirgood, and (ii) fides, which goes far beyond the literaltranslation faithfulness and includes not onlyexclusivity and permanence but also the positive readiness andcommitment to being united with one's spouse in mind, body and amutually assisting domestic life. aquinas neither subordinates one ofthese two ends to the other, nor regards it asappropriate to choose to divide them. fides is a good andsufficient reason for engaging in the usus matrimonii, thekind of sexual act that is intended to enable both husband and wife toexperience and in a particular way actualize and express the good of theirmarriage, so that the act's giving and receiving of delight is token of theircommitment.consequently the kind of wrongful sexual choice most often consideredby aquinas is engaging in intercourse with one's spouse withoutfides, because one either (i) is thinking of one'sspouse in the way one would think of a prostitute, or (significantlyworse) (ii) would be willing to have sex with somebody else if someother attractive person were to be available. such depersonalized sexacts are instances of willing against the good of marriage (contrabonum matrimonii). this reiterated analysis should be regarded asthe key to aquinas' sex ethics. another paradigmatic kind of instance,in itself much more serious, is a married person's choice tohave intercourse with some third party (perhaps with the otherspouse's consent). all other wrongful kinds of sex act havetheir wrongfulness, according to aquinas, not because they areunnatural in some biological or sociological sense ofunnatural, but because they are against reason'sdirective to respect, if not also pursue, the good of marriage, arespect that calls for reserving to marriage and truly maritalintercourse all uses of one's capacity to engage in theintentional pursuit of sexual satisfaction. for unless one regardssuch reservation as required, one's stance about human sex actsis contra bonum matrimonii and unreasonable because onecannot coherently maintain that the intercourse of the married enablesthem to actualize and experience their fides and theirmarriage, a thought essential to the flourishing (bonum)of marriage and thus of children and thus of the wider community as awhole. one measure of the gravity of morally bad sex acts isapplicable to some kinds but not others: injustice (as in rape orseduction of the vulnerable). another measure, applicable to all suchacts, is the extent of the deviance (distance) betweenacts of that kind and truly marital acts.as in ours, many in aquinas' milieu found it difficult tounderstand how mutually agreeable sex could be a serious moral issue,or indeed a moral issue at all. aquinas noted this, but was clear thatevery kind of conduct that acts out and thus confirms and reinforces adisposition of will contra bonum matrimonii is seriously wrongbecause so many aspects of individual and social flourishing profoundlydepend upon the health of the institution of marriage, as it exists inthe real lives of adults and children. it is worth repeating, since thepoint is so often misunderstood and misreported, that aquinas'moral arguments for distinguishing good from bad sex never runfrom natural to thereforegood/reasonable/right, but always fromgood/reasonable/right to therefore natural(and similarly, of course, for unreasonable and unnatural): see ii-iiq. 153 a. 2c, a. 3c, q. 154 a. 1c, a. 2 ad 2, a. 11.3.4.3 lyingaquinas' thesis is that lying, properly defined, is always to beexcluded as to some extent wrong. the thesis is often misunderstood as beingpremised on the thought that lying is contrary to the natural function oftongue or speech, a thought that has often been transposed into aneffort to explain his theses about the wrong kinds of sex act. but, ashas been seen, his sex ethics has another and more plausible basis,and so, it seems (albeit less clearly), has his ethics oflying. though all his treatments include something like wordsare naturally signs of what one understand (st ii-ii q. 110a. 3) or speech was invented for expressing the conceptions inone's heart (sent. iii d. 38 a. 3c), thisstatement is pointing to a more explanatory and prior premise,discernible though never adequately articulated so as to show itsrelation to basic human goods. this prior premise turns on hisdefinition of lying as one's assertion of what onebelieves to be false. whenever one asserts, one affirms as true twopropositions: explicitly the proposition one articulates as truedespite one's belief that it is not, and implicitly theproposition that one believes what one is assertively articulating. soaquinas seems to locate the essential wrongfulness of lying in this intentionaldissonance between the self presented or reported andone's real self: a duplicitas. it is often reasonableand even morally necessary to hide one's beliefs, and this, notdeception, is what aquinas means by the prudentdissimulatio he thinks justifiable in appropriatecontexts. but one should not do so by the spurious self-projectionentailed by asserting what one believes false. pretended flight as adevice for luring an unjust enemy into an ambush can be right in ajust war, but lying to the enemy is wrong, although its gravity ismuch diminished by the duty not to reveal the truth to the enemy, aduty compatible with the coexisting duty not to lie. subsequentscholars in his tradition have wondered whether the conditions ofdiscourse with an unjust opponent do not, at least in manycircumstances, defeat the presumption that a grammatically indicativestatement asserts what it is put forward to seem toassert.3.4.4 exceptionless negative norms: more urgent though not all or always more importantnegative norms such as the three sets of norms just discussed aremore urgent and direct as implications of love of self and neighbor,but are not necessarily more important in other dimensions ofimportance. that is to say, they are applicable and to be followedsemper et ad semper, always and in all circumstances, whereasthe applicability of affirmative norms (requiring one to actin a specified kind of way) is semper sed non ad semper:always applicable subject to there being (as is not always thecase) suitable circumstances. kinds of conduct that are contrary to anegative moral norm of this type are intrinsicallywrongful (intrinsece mala).only negative norms can be exceptionless (and not all negative moralnorms are). if affirmative norms could be exceptionless, there would beinescapable conflicts of obligation, but since morality is simply (the set of standards of) fullreasonableness, there can be no conflict of duties each trulyand inescapably obligatory in one and the same situation: one cannottruly be perplexus simpliciter that is, in a dilemmasuch that, through no fault of one's own, any choice one makeswill be immoral. (it is, however, possible that my prior wrongfulchoices or my culpable negligence in forming my conscience put me intoa situation such that i have applicable and irreconcilable duties andwill be in breach of one or more of them whatever i choose or do oromit: i am then perplexus secundum quid, that is, in a dilemmabut of a qualified, derivative kind, only in a weak senseunavoidable.)4. virtuesa virtue is an aspect of, or constitutive element in, being a personof good character. to have the virtues is to have a stable and readywillingness to make choices that are morally good because in line withthe bonum rationis, the basic good of practicalreasonableness.4.1 specified by principles identifying the reasonable meanthe virtues, like everything else in one's will, are aresponse to reasons. but practical reasons (i.e. reasons for action)are propositional: they can be stated as principles and otherstandards, more or less specific. so principles, ultimately the firstprinciples of practical reason (that is, of natural law), are morefundamental to ethics than virtues are. aquinas acceptsaristotle's notion that every virtue is a mean between too muchand too little, and he constantly stresses that it is reason withthe principles and rules (regulae) it understands thatsettles the mean and thus determines what is too much or too little.indeed, the principles of practical reason (natural law) establish theends of the virtues: st ii-ii q. 47 a. 6. and the mastervirtue of bringing practical reasonableness into all one'sdeliberations, choices, and carrying out of choices the virtueof prudentia, a virtue both intellectual (of one'sintelligence) and moral (of one's whole will and character) is part of the definition, content, and influence ofevery other moral virtue: st i-ii q. 65 a. 1, q. 66 a. 3 ad 3,etc.aquinas arranged the summa theologiae's exposition ofmorality within a classification, not of the goods to which rationalacts are directed, nor of types of act, nor of practical reason'sstandards, but of the virtues. explicable as a reflective theologicalproject of depicting the flourishing or deviations of human beings inan account of the whole movement of creature from their origin to theirfulfillment, his decision to adopt this superstructure has tended toobscure the real foundations of his ethics. as one would expect fromthe considerations sketched in the preceding paragraph, his actualarguments about what is right and wrong, virtuous or vicious, get theirpremises not from analysis of the virtues at stake but rather from theprinciples and more specific standards, norms, precepts or rules ofpractical reason(ableness). it is the conclusions of these argumentsthat are then re-expressed in terms of what is contrary to or in linewith one or more of the virtues.4.2 virtue can also be a source, rather than conclusion, of moral judgmentone's affirmative responsibilities are all conditioned bycircumstances, and mostly are (conditional) implications of the goldenrule of doing to or for others what you would wish them to doto or for you. for both these reasons, one cannot make sound judgmentsabout what one should be doing that is, about what is themean of reasonableness unless one's wishesare those of a person who understands the opportunities and thecircumstances well, and whose concerns and intentions are those ofsomeone whose reasonableness is not corrupted or deflected either bysub-rational desires and aversions or by deformations of will such aspride or presumption. such a person has the virtues, intellectual andmoral, and virtue is thus, and in these respects, required for soundmoral judgment. sometimes the mean of reason, properly assessed bysomeone of true virtue, calls for heroic virtue (say, immense courage)far beyond conventional measures or expectations of reasonableness,moderation, and the like.4.2.1 the interdependence of the virtuesaquinas firmly holds the platonic-aristotelian theses (i) of theconnexio virtutum: that to have any of the virtues in its fulland proper form one must have all of them, and (ii) of the governingand shaping role of (the good of) practical reasonableness (bonumrationis), that is, of the intellectual and moral virtue ofprudentia. for some indication why, see 4.4 below..4.3 virtue's priority not reducible to self-fulfillmentjust as some take aquinas to hold that concern for one's ownhappiness is the source of one's moral motivation and judgment,so some take him to hold that the point of being virtuous is beingvirtuous. but a sounder reading may understand him to hold thatattaining beatitudo and virtus are more like built-inbeneficial side-effects of openness to the beatitudo ofeveryone that is, of love of neighbor as oneself, according toa reasonable order of priorities. what virtue (the state of character)is praised for, he says, is its actualizing the good ofreason(ableness), and reason is good because it enables one to discernthings for what they truly are and so, in the practical domain,to discern real benefits (bona, opportunities) and directone's choices and actions to bringing them about in the realpeople for whom one thereby makes effective one's love andrespect.4.4 the cardinal virtuesaquinas accepts the platonic-aristotelian thesis that there are fourvirtues which are cardinal, that is on which the moral life and allother virtues hinge or depend: prudentia, justice, courage,and temperantia. each is a strategic element in one'sintegrating of the good of practical reasonableness into one'sdeliberations, choices and execution of choices (prudentia),in one's dealings with others justice), and in integrating andgoverning one's desires by genuine reasons (temperantia)and enabling one to face down intimidating obstacles (courage, fortitudo).4.4.1 prudentia and lovepractical reasonableness involves not only (i) an intelligent andrationally integrated understanding of practical reason'sprinciples and of the implications that, under the auspices of themaster principle of love of neighbor as self, they have in the form ofmoral standards, but also (ii) the personal self-governance needed toput those conscientious judgments into effect by choices andcorresponding action. so prudentia has many phases or, asaquinas says, parts, and enters into every other virtue. it is farremoved from prudence in the sense of rationalself-interest, for by prudentia one is actively awarethat self-interest is self-stunting or indeed self-destructive unlessone transcends it by one's dispositions and acts of justice andfriendship or love. (and see 2.7 above.)although aquinas subscribes to aristotle's thesis thatpractical reasonableness (phronesis, prudentia)concerns means rather than ends, he eliminates any quasi-humeianreading of that thesis by emphasizing that what movesprudentia is not one's passions but one'sunderivative understanding of the first practical principles and of theintelligible goods to which they point (synderesis movetprudentiam: st ii-ii q. 47 a. 6 ad 3). moreover, since heholds that virtually all means are also ends, the aristotelian thesisin no way inhibits him from holding that prudentia is whatguides one in identifying moral standards and the mean ofevery virtue: prudentia directs the moral virtues notonly in choosing means but also in establishing ends: i-ii q. 66a. 3 ad 3.4.4.2 justicejustice is the steady and lasting willingness to give to others whatthey are entitled to (their right: jus [or ius]suum). aquinas works with this roman law definition(st ii-ii q. 58 a. 1c), and with aristotle's division ofjustice into (i) distributive (good judgment about how todivide up and parcel out beneficial or burdensome wholes or sets in away that is fair because guided by appropriate criteria) and (ii) whataquinas calls commutative justice (good judgment going farwider than aristotle's corrective justice, andconcerned with all other kinds of dealings between persons). hisprioritizing of the concept of right (jus), conceived assomething that belongs to another, brings him to the brink ofarticulating a concept of human rights, a concept certainly implicit inhis thesis that there are precepts of justice each imposing, on me and mycommunities, a duty to everyone without discrimination(indifferenter omnibus debitum: st ii-ii q. 122 a.6). for his definition of justice immediately entails that correlativeto such duties of justice there must be rights that belong to everyoneindifferenter. many duties of justice are positive(affirmative duties to give, do, etc.), and aquinas treats the dutiesof relieving poverty both under justice and under love (of neighbor,for god's sake). the duties in either case are essentially thesame, and aquinas' understanding of them strongly affects hisunderstanding of justified private property rights, which are validbecause needed for prosperity and development, but are subject to aduty to distribute, directly or indirectly, one'ssuperflua that is, everything beyond what oneneeds to keep oneself and one's family in the state of lifeappropriate to one's (and their) vocation(s). for the naturalresources of the world are by nature common; that is,reason's principles do not identify anyone as having a priorclaim to them other than under some customary or other socially positedscheme for division and appropriation of such resources, and suchschemes could not be morally authoritative unless they acknowledgedsome such duty to distribute one's superflua.4.4.3 fortitudo and temperantiathough one's passions, that is one's emotional desiresand aversions, support one's reason in deliberation, choice andaction, they are also always capable of deflecting one from reasonableand right choice. so the ready disposition to keep these passions intheir proper role is an essential element of a virtuous character andlife. by temperantia one integrates one's desires,particularly but not only for sexual pleasure, with reason, lest reasonbe enslaved by passion and become its ingenious servant, as it readilycan. temperantia is the mean, for example, between lust andfrigidity or apathy (aquinas everywhere rejecting anystoic ideal of passionlessness, and holding that there isgood as well as bad concupiscentia).by fortitudo one keeps one's aversions, particularlybut not only fear, in check lest one shirk one's moralresponsibilities in situations of danger or other adversity. it is themean between recklessness or over-boldness and cowardice ordefeatism.4.5 virtue ethicsin recent decades various philosophers and theologians have proposedthat ethics done well is virtue ethics, not an ethics of rules andprinciples. an ethics of the latter kind is denounced as legalistic. asshould be clear from the foregoing, aquinas rejects the proposedcontrast and gives systematic prominence both to standards, such asprinciples and rules, and to virtues. he holds, in effect, that theyare interdefined. nor does he have any time for the view that there areno exceptionless moral norms and that moral norms or other standardsare no more than a kind of anticipation, shadow or approximation of thejudgments which in each situation need to be made by a person ofvirtue, and which could never exclude in advance any kind ofact as always wrongful by reason of its object and regardless of itsfurther intentions or the circumstances of the situation. on thecontrary, he holds that no human act is morally good (right, in thesense of not wrong) unless it is in line with love of self and neighbor(and thus with respect for the basic aspects of the wellbeing of eachand all human beings) not only (i) in the motives or intentions withwhich it is chosen, and (ii) in the appropriateness of thecircumstances, but also (iii) in its object (more precisely the object,or closest-in intention of the choosing person) (see 2.1.1 above). thisis the primary sense of the axiom he frequently articulates by quotingan old tag: bonum ex integra causa, malum ex quocumque defectu(good from an unflawed set of contributing factors, bad from any defectin the set). that is, there is a fundamental asymmetry between moralgood and moral evil a notion very foreign to any version ofutilitarian or post-utilitarian consequentialist orproportionalist ethics.5. political communitylove of neighbor as oneself requires one to live in politicalcommunity with others. for the wellbeing and right(s) of all or almostall of us are dependent upon there being in place institutions ofgovernment and law of the relatively comprehensive kind we callpolitical and state.5.1 common goodcommon good is very often a safer translation ofbonum commune than the common good. for there isthe common good of a team, but equally the common good of a universityclass, of a university, of a family, of a neighborhood, of a city, of astate, of a church and of human kind throughout the world. thedifference in each case between the group's common good and anaggregate of the wellbeing of each of its members can be understood byconsidering how, in a real friendship, a wills b's wellbeing forb's sake, while b wills a's wellbeing for a's sake,and each therefore has reason to will his or her own wellbeing for theother's sake, with the result that neither envisages his or herown wellbeing as the source (the object) of the friendship'svalue, and each has in view a truly common good, not reducibleto the good of either taken separately or merely summed. inasmuch asthere is possible and appropriate a kind of friendship between themembers of each of the kinds of group listed (non-exhaustively) above,each such group has its own common good.5.1.1 groupscommunities such as those just mentioned are groups, each of them awhole [totum] made up of persons (and perhaps of othergroups), their unity being not merely one of composition or conjunctionor continuity, but rather of order, in two dimensions: (i) ofthe parts (members) as coordinating with each other, and (ii) of thegroup and its members to its organizing purpose or end(finis). of these, (ii) is the more explanatory, as aquinasargues at the very beginning of his commentary on aristotle'sethics.5.2 political common good and political community relativizedsome of the above-listed kinds of group have, in aquinas'view, a significance that is in a sense strategic. in particular, thefamily-cum-household, the political group, and the church establishedto transmit divine revelation and salvation each have suchsignificance. the benefits made possible by political community, withits state government and law, are such that its common good is bothextensive and intensive in its reach and implications (e.g. thelegitimacy of securing it by coercion). so on those occasions whenthe common good is the best translation of bonumcommune, the referent will normally be the good of the politicalcommunity in question (or of political communities generically), oftencalled by aquinas public good.nevertheless, aquinas's use of the aristotelian axiom,human beings are naturally political animals almostalways takes it as asserting our social, not solitary, nature our need for interpersonal relationships both for friendship and forsuch necessities as food, clothing, speech, and so forth. so the axiomshould not be made to mean that aquinas thinks there is a distinctbasic inclination towards, or a distinct basic good, of politicalcommunity, to put alongside the distinct basic good of marriage andfamily. he accepts that we are naturally parts of a politicalcommunity, but also that we are more naturally conjugal than political(in the narrow sense), and that political community does not properlyhave the ultimacy it has for aristotle. for aquinas, politicalcommunities have been irrevocably relativized by the appropriatenessfor (in principle) everyone of belonging to the church which is, in itsown way, as complete [perfecta] a kind of community as anystate.moreover, aristotle's claim that the polis isgreater and more godlike than any other human communityis put by aquinas into a horizon which contains not merely the onecivitas (latin for polis) of which i am amember but rather the whole plurality of peoples and civitates(states, political communities): eth. viii.4.1112. so for himthe common good that is the ultimate concern of political philosophy,and thus of the reasonable person, is nothing less than the fulfillmentof all human persons and communities (and see 3.2 above).still, this wider perspective does not lead aquinas to develop atheory of international community; this had to be developed by hissixteenth-century followers. indeed, he takes remarkably littleinterest in a number of important issues related to the plurality ofstates and the dynamics of state-formation, and the appropriaterelationship between a people [populus, gens, etc.]and a state (should each people presumptively have a state?). hispolitical philosophy explores with subtlety and care the state[civitas, regnum, etc.], almost as if there weresimply a single permanent political community.6. the state a complete community with mixed and limited governmentthe state is a complete community, whose members, inthe central case, are also members of another completecommunity, the church. so this completeness is, in each case,relative and delimited. correspondingly, the state's governingstructures (which aquinas does not call the state) are again in the central, morally proper case limited infour distinct ways.6.1 four kinds of limitation on state government and law(i) state governments and laws are subject to moral standards,especially but not only the principles and norms of justice. this doesnot mean that moral principles all apply to public authority in the waythey do to private persons; they do not, yet there is no exemption ofpublic authorities from the exceptionless moral norms againstintentionally killing the innocent, lying, rape and other extra-maritalsex, and so forth. moreover, this limitation has no bearing on thedistinct question which moral standards should, or can properly, belegally enforced by the state's government and law (see (iii)below).(ii) state governments are subject to laws governing election orother appointment to and tenure and rotation of office, and thejurisdiction of particular offices. even supreme rulers not subject tothe coercive authority of anyone else cannot dispense themselves fromthe obligation of their own laws unless that is for the common good andfree from favoritism. if they defy these moral restrictions they showthemselves to be tyrants, and may be resisted and deposed by theconcerted (public) action of their people. the best formof government (or as we would now say, constitution) is one in which,well mixed, are found monarchy,aristocracy and democracy, that is, therule of one person (whose monarchy is probablybetter elective rather than hereditary), governing in concert with afew high officials chosen for their excellence of characterand aptitude, by an electorate comprising the many who areentitled both to vote and to stand for election: st i-ii q.105 a. 1. establishing and maintaining such an arrangement is a matterfor laws which delimit the competences of all concerned.(iii) state governments and laws have the authority and duty topromote and defend the common good, including the good of virtue. thisresponsibility brings with it the authority to use coercion for thesuppression of crime and enemy attack. this coercive jurisdictionextends to defending persons and property both by force and by thecredible threat of punishment for criminal or other unjustappropriation or damage. but it does not extend to enforcing any partof morality other than the requirements of justice insofar asthey can be violated by acts external to the choosing andacting person's will. acts of virtues (or vices) other than suchexternal acts of inter-personal (in)justice cannot rightly beprohibited unless they involve (in)justice. for, unlike divinelaw's, human law's purpose is the temporaltranquility of the state, a purpose which the law attains by coercivelyprohibiting external acts to the extent that these evils candisturb the peaceful state of the state. st i-ii q. 98a. 1c; likewise q. 100 a. 2c: human law does not put forwardprecepts about anything other than acts of justice [andinjustice]. state law's justifiedly coercive domain is notprivate good as such, nor the whole of the community's commongood. rather, it is those aspects of the political community'scommon good that can be called public good, and that are affected byexternal acts directly or indirectly affecting other members of thecommunity.(iv) the morally significant authority of the state'sgovernment and law is limited by the rights of the church, though whenthat government and law are within their proper domain, one ought tocomply with their directives rather than any purported act ofadministration or government (apart from general moral teaching) bypope or bishops.the last three kinds of limitation can be considered here in alittle more detail.6.2 limited government's forms: political and regalgovernment is properly speaking political when thesupreme person or body has power which is limited[potestas coarctata or limitata] by certain lawsof the state: pol. i.1.5. such rulers govern inaccordance with the laws concerning the establishment of their office,their appointment and their responsibilities. when power is, bycontrast, plenary, the government is said to beregal in kind. but even regal government, in its properforms, is the government of free and equal people who have in somesense (never made quite clear by aquinas) the right to resist[ius repugnandi] the ruler(s). even regal rulers aresubject to the directive force of the laws, though there is no-one whohas the legal authority to coerce them.aquinas sees no need for any social contract toexplain or justify the origins of government or of any particularregime. but he does think that, even in regal as distinct frompolitical rule, the enacted laws constitute a kind of covenant[pactum] between king and people (in rom. 13.1v. 6), and violation of this by the ruler can entail that subjects arereleased from their covenantal obligation.in principle, aquinas thinks, the supreme legislative powers are heldeither by the whole people [tota multitudo], a free people[libera multitudo], or by some public persona whohas responsibility [cura] for them and represents them[gerit personam multitudinis: bears their persona]: i-iiq. 97 a. 3 ad 3; ii-ii q. 57 a. 2. neither the meaning of thisrepresentation nor the practicalities of designating arepresentative are explored in any depth by aquinas. nor does hediscuss how it gets settled whether a particular people is (i) simplyfree and self-governing, or (ii) free but subject to the legislativeauthority of some princeps, or (iii) unfree (perhaps becauseconquered).6.3 state authority is neither paternalistic nor divinethough he never openly confronts them, aquinas sets aside thesayings at the end of aristotle's ethics which seem tomean that the polis has the responsibility and role ofcoercively leading all its citizens, of every age, towards all-roundvirtue. aquinas plainly rejects the idea that the state is a surrogatefor paternal authority, or has god's authority over morallysignificant conduct. though he frequently states that the politicalrulers have a proper concern to lead people to virtue, these statementsturn out to refer to the appropriate aspirations of rulers, not totheir coercive jurisdiction or authority. in the context of thesurrounding argument, the statements do not commit him to any widergovernmental or legal authority than to require and foster the publicgood and the virtue of justice, that is, the willingness to performone's duties to others: 6.1(iii) above. the othervirtues can be legally required of citizens only so far as theyimpact on justice: st i-ii q. 96 a. 3. moreover, he holds theclassic position that doing justice does not require that one'smotivations and character be just. and when it comes to coercivemeasures, he holds that they can bear only upon conduct that isexternal and immediately or mediately affects other people unjustly ordisturbs the peace of the political community: st i-ii q. 98a. 1. really private vices are outside the coercive jurisdiction of thestate's government and law. though political authority isultimately derived from divine authority, it is not to be exercised inthe same all-encompassing way as god does when directing one (likeevery other human individual) to the complete and heavenly fulfillmentgratuitously and supernaturally offered to us all by god. absolutepolitical authority of the kind later claimed by rulers such as james iof england is contrary to aquinas' constant teaching.this reading of aquinas as, in a nineteenth and twentieth centuryjargon, a liberal (or the first whig) isoften disputed, for there are statements in his writings which takenacontextually seem to assert the simpler and paternalistic aristotelianposition.6.4 the state shares its authority with another complete communityone of the reasons why aquinas' political theory departssignificantly from aristotle's is that aquinas believes he hasaccess to facts and considerations unavailable to aristotle, namely tothe public divine revelation completed in the works and sayings ofchrist, founder of a spiritual community, the (catholic =universal) church. when political life is reallywell-ordered, therefore, each member (citizen) of a state will be alsoa member of this other complete community and subject toits laws as well as to the state's. the function of this othercommunity is to transmit the divine promise or offer of eternal life,and to help people help each other, through their own individual freechoices, to become ready for that life. with the establishing of thiscommunity (in continuity and discontinuity with the older religiouscommunity of israel), human associations are henceforth of twofundamentally distinct types: (i) temporal or secular, worldly, civil,or political, and (ii) spiritual. correspondingly, responsibility forhuman affairs is divided between (i) secular societies, especiallystates and families, and (ii) the church. the distinction betweensecular and spiritual tracks that between natural and revealedknowledge.6.4.1 non-dependence and non-subjection of secular authorityaccordingly, the church's leaders have no jurisdiction oversecular matters, although they can declare that the choice of a memberof the church, albeit in a secular matter, is seriously immoral. aparent has no jurisdiction over a child's free choices except inso far as they violate the moral rights of other members of the familyor the parents' responsibility for the child's educationand moral upbringing. state government and law have no right to directthe church's leaders, or its members in their religious affairs,except in so far as the state's peace and justice wouldotherwise be violated. in those matters which pertain topolitical good [bonum civile], secular rather than spiritualauthority should be obeyed. sent. ii d. 44 ex. ad4.neither those who adhere to the old, incomplete revelation (jews),nor those people and peoples who simply do not accept the truth of thefull revelation, are subject to the authority of the church. nor is thelegitimacy and authority of a government negated by the fact that itsmembers (officials) are unbelievers.beyond this, aquinas works within the constitutional assumptions ofthe christendom of his era. his positions imply that if ecclesiasticalauthorities expel members from the church for their misdeeds as rulers,the consequences under their particular state's ownconstitutional arrangement could include the rulers'deposition (loss of secular legal authority); but aquinas blurs orelides this distinction of jurisdictions, and loosely says that thechurch has the authority of curbing secular rulers(st ii-ii q. 12 a. 2 ad 1).6.4.2 heresy, unbelief and religious freedomaquinas accepts the teaching of the church of his era that no onecan rightly be compelled to accept the christian faith or membership ofthe church, but that those who are members can and should be compelledby both ecclesiastical and state law to abstain from any publicrenunciation of it. he treats such renunciation as an actionable breachof promise (passing silently over the fact that in most cases thepromise was made not by the persons concerned but rather, in theirearly infancy, by their parents). and he regards public teaching ofheresy as comparable to counterfeiting coin of the realm and thereforerightly punishable capitally by the secular authorities (the fact offalse teaching having been ascertained by an ecclesiastical trial). hisviews about this matter are explicitly based on the evolving traditionof the church and on what historical experience suggested were theeffects of more permissive political or legal arrangements. so thereare no theoretical obstacles to his ready acceptance of the judgment oflater theologians and church teachers that, as experience shows, it ismore compatible with basic positions in his moral and politicalphilosophy to hold that authentically personal judgment and freelychosen commitment are so important in relation to ultimate questionsthat all persons (even those whose beliefs about religion are false orill-formed) have a moral right, and should have the corresponding legalright, to be free from state (and ecclesiastical) coercion in religiousbelief or action except in so far as their conduct would be contrary tothe rights of others or to public peace or to public morality (that is,morality so far as it concerns actions which impact on the public)(second vatican council, declaration on religious liberty(1965)). nor is it clear how he could resist the objection that, evenif those baptized in infancy ratify the promises made on their behalfat baptism, the subscription of faith is not an undertaking to otherpeople or the community, but rather is a matter which, as he says in aneglected passage elsewhere in his major writings (scg iii c.80 n. 15), pertains to that person alone as an individual[secundum se ipsum].7. lawthe best developed part of aquinas' political theory is hisaccount of law. that account's main features may be summarized infour propositions about the central case and focal meaning of law. itis a matter of intelligent direction addressed to the intelligence andreason of those whom it directs. it is for the common good of apolitical community. it is made (positum, put in place) by theruler(s) responsible for the community in question. it needs to becoercive.7.1 law is an appeal to reasonaquinas' well-known discussion of law in st i-ii qq.9097 (a discussion which actually extends through the less studied qq.98105) has been justly admired by jurists and other thinkers nototherwise much interested in his work. but it is shaped by his concernthere (i) to present for beginner students of theology an overview ofthe universe and of the vast sweep of creatures out from their divinecreator and back to the same transcendent being as their ultimatedestiny, and (ii) to synthesize the traditional vocabulary and classictheological sources on law. so prominence is there given to theeternal law by which god governs even inanimate creatures(as by the laws of physics, etc.), and to theparticipation of natural moral law in that eternal law.but when he is free from these textbookish constraints he emphasizesthat law's most essential feature is something which is not trueof the laws of nature (physics, biology, etc.), namely that it is anappeal to the mind, choice, moral strength (virtus) and loveof those subject to the law: scg iii cc. 114117; this isquietly indicated also in st i-ii q. 91 a. 2 ad 3.law (in its central case and focal meaning) is thus always a plan for co-ordination through freecooperation. the structure of things being what it is, the principlesof practical reason and morality (natural moral law and natural right)can be understood, accepted, and lived by, as fully directive inconscience, without needing to be regarded as (what they really are) anappeal from mind to mind, a plan freely madeto be freely adopted for integral human fulfillment. as the divinecreator was in no way constrained to choose to create this universe asdistinct from any other good possible universe, so human legislatorshave wide moral freedom to choose amongst alternative possible legalarrangements, making one set of provisions legally and (presumptively)morally obligatory by the sheer fact of adopting it that is, bywhat aquinas calls the law-makers' determinatio: i-ii q.95 a. 2; q. 99 a. 3 ad 2; q. 104 a. 1..7.2 law is for a political community's common goodthe definition of law offered by aquinas in st i-ii q. 90a. 4 is: an ordinance of reason for the common good of a[complete] community, promulgated by the person or body responsible forlooking after that community. it is by being intended for commongood that law appeals to its subjects' reason, and gives themreason for regarding the law as authoritative and obligatory, morallyas well as legally. even when its subjects or some of them would havemade or preferred a different determinatio, a different way ofpursuing communal benefit, the rulers' intent to promote commongood supports and is supported by their claim to rulership. only ifthey have such intent can they instantiate the central case ofgovernment.7.2.1 the rule of lawthe central case of government is the rule of a free people, and lawis centrally instantiated when its fully public character(promulgation: q. 90 a. 4), and its clarity (q. 95 a.3), generality (q.96 a. 1), stability (q. 97 a. 2), and practicability (q. 95 a. 3),enable government (law-makers and law-maintainers alike) and subjectsto be partners in public reason (aquinas has the concept though not the phrase). the features of law thus itemized by aquinas amount tothe concept of the rule of law, which he clearly gives a priority overthe rule of men in his treatment of judges'subordination to legislation and of the duty of judges to adhere to laweven against the evidence of their own eyes (when that evidence is notlegally admissible): ii-ii q. 67 a. 2; q. 64 a. 6 ad 3.7.3 law is posited by the responsible authoritythe person or body that has the care of the communityis entitled to make laws. aquinas treats all human law asposited and (synonymously) positive, eventhose of its rules that are restatements of, or authoritativelypromulgated deductions (conclusiones) from, generalmoral principles or norms. interpretation, too, aquinas thinks of asinvolving, in the last analysis, an appeal to the legislator(s) todeclare what the enacted law truly means.the making of law by custom is not incompatible with this thesis; itamounts to a positing of law by the people, considered as having adiffused authority and responsibility for their own community.even in a paradise unflawed by any human vice, there would, aquinasthinks, have been need for government and for law, though notnecessarily political government, still less coercivelaw. for social life needs a considerable amount of common policy andcommon action which cannot otherwise than by authoritativedeterminatio be achieved by a group whose members have manyideas perhaps all of them good about priorities andways to proceed: st i q. 96 a. 4. a determinatio, ifit is just and fit to be authoritative, must have a rational connectionto principles of practical reasonableness. but that rational connectionis like an architect's decisions about dimensions; they must berationally connected to the terms of the commission (e.g. to build amaternity hospital, not a lion's cage) but these terms, whileexcluding various options, leave many options entirely open (the doorsmust be more than 1 foot high but as between 7.1 and 7.2 feet thechoice is entirely free, and likewise with every dimension, selectionof materials, colors, and so forth).7.4 law needs to be coercivein a world (paradise) of saints (completely virtuous persons), therewould be need for law but not for coercion; so coercion is not part ofaquinas's definition of law and law's directive force canbe contrasted with its coercive force (and see 6.1(ii) above). but inour actual world the need for (the threat of) coercion is such thataquinas will say without qualification that law ought to have coerciveforce [vis coactiva] as well as directive [visdirectiva]; he even says that it is a characteristic of law[de ratione legis] (st i-ii q. 96 a. 5), despite notincluding it in his official definition of law's nature [itsratio] (q. 90. a. 3).it is not quite accurate to say that the state or its government has amonopoly of force, since one can justifiably use force as a citizen todefend oneself or others from an attack or assault that is not itselfjustified (being criminal or insane), and this requires noauthorization. still, aquinas insistently draws a distinction betweenprivate and public use of force. only public authority can punish orrightly engage in war, and it is reasonable for public authorities toseek a virtual monopoly on what would now be called police operationsfor the prevention, suppression, and detection of crime. privatepersons can never rightly intend precisely to harm or kill, thoughthey can knowingly bring about harm or death as a proportionateside-effect of intending to block an attack (3.4.1 above). personswith public authority can, aquinas thinks, rightly intend to kill (orinjure) in the exercise of their duty to suppress the attacks ofcriminals, pirates, and other public or private enemies. (he does notexplore those borderland or badland wild west situations where the distinction between public and private isindistinct.)the paradigmatic public use of coercion is judicially imposedpunishment, capital or otherwise. at the core of aquinas'saccount of justified punishment is the notion that offenders arepunishable because, in choosing to offend, they have excessivelyindulged their will and thereby (he implies) gained a kind of advantageover those who have retrained their own wills from such excess; a justrelationship between themselves and their fellow citizens can fittinglybe restored by proportionately imposing upon such offenders somethingcontra voluntatem, contrary to and suppressive of their will:i-ii q. 46 a. 6 ad 2. this restoration of a fair balance betweenoffenders and the law-abiding is central to what aquinas frequentlycalls the medicinal function of punishment, for themedicine of punishment is intended to heal not only offenders (byreforming them) or potential offenders (by deterring them), but alsoand more centrally the whole community by rectifying the disorder ofinjustice created by the offender's self-preferential violationof justice. on capital punishment see 3.4.1 above.aquinas regards as legitimate ground for going to war not only thedefence of this or another political community, but also the purpose ofjustly punishing and/or securing compensation. (as justifiable groundsfor use of force, it is difficult to distinguish between (i) defence ofone's own community's (or another's) territory andconstitution, (ii) the recovery or restoration of unjustly takenterritory or other possessions, and (iii) exaction of compensation forunjust takings or other injuries.)7.5 unjust law and just revolutionif the law purports to require actions that no-one should ever do,it cannot rightly be complied with; one's moral obligation is notto obey but to disobey: st i-ii q. 96 a. 4. and if it purportsto authorize such acts (e.g. rape, theft, or infanticide), itsauthorization is morally void and of no effect (ii-ii q. 57 a. 2 ad 2);courts should not guide their adjudications by such laws (ii-ii q. 60a. 5 ad 1). but law's obligatoriness and authority is subject tofurther conditions, derived from the very nature and rationale ofpolitical authority. if the law-makers (i) are motivated not by concernfor the community's common good but by greed or vanity (privatemotivations that make them tyrants, whatever the content of theirlegislation), or (ii) act outside the authority granted to them, or(iii) while acting with a view to the common good apportion thenecessary burdens unfairly, their laws are unjust and in the forum ofreasonable conscience are not so much laws as acts of violence[magis sunt violentiae quam leges]: i-ii q. 96 a. 4. such lawslack moral authority, i.e. do not bind in conscience; one is neithermorally obliged to conform nor morally obliged not to conform.this conclusion is subject to a proviso or exception: laws which areunjust by reason of one or more of these three enumerated types ofdefect in authority sometimes create an obligation in conscience justto the extent that disobedience would cause disorder or give the kindof example that leads others into wrongdoing. to avoidthose sorts of unjust harm to public and private good one may have amoral obligation to forgo one's right(s) [iuri suo debetcedere]. this obligation is not: to comply with the law accordingto its makers' intent, and/or to the meaning it has under theparticular legal system's interpretative canons. rather, it is akind of collateral obligation: to avoid those acts of non-compliancethat would unjustly risk having the bad side-effects of being seen notto comply.all who govern in the interests of themselves rather than of thecommon good are tyrants, for that is what a tyrant is in the classicalline of thought followed by aquinas. tyranny entails treatingone's subjects as slaves persons used for the benefit ofthe master. the laws of tyrants are not laws simpliciter, butrather a kind of perversion of law [perversitas legis], andone is, in principle, entitled to treat them as one treats abandit's demands: i-ii q. 92 a 1 ad 4 5; ii-ii q. 69 a. 4.against the regime's efforts to enforce its decrees one has theright of forcible resistance; as a private right this could extend asfar as killing the tyrant as a foreseen side-effect of one'slegitimate self-defence. it is the tyrant rather than the subject whois morally guilty of sedition. if one can associate with others toconstitute oneself with them a kind of public authority willing andable to assume responsibility for the common good of the state, one isentitled, in aquinas' view, to set about overthrowing, and ifneed be executing, the tyrant, with a view to the liberatio ofthe people [multitudinis] and the homeland [patriae].since rulers who are not tyrants are entitled to hunt down and mostseverely punish sedition, and both rulers and subjects may fall intoerror about each other's moral status, subjects ought to be slowto judge a tyranny so unjust that overthrowing or forcibly resisting itis fair to those likely to be injured as a side-effect of revolutionarystruggle; there is a (defeasible) presumption in favor of acquiescenceand merely passive disobedience: ii-ii q. 42 a. 2 ad 3, q. 104 a. 6 ad3; ii sent. d. 44 q. 2 a. 2; reg. 1.6.bibliographya. works of thomas aquinas[eth] sententia libri ethicorum (commentaryon aristotle's nicomachean ethics) [12712].[mal] quaestiones disputatae de malo(disputed questions on evil) [126971].[reg] de regno [or de regimineprincipum] ad regem cyprum (on government [orkingship] [or on the rule of princes/politicalleaders] to the king of cyprus) [c. 1265].[scg] summa contra gentiles (a treatise against theunbelievers) [?125965].[sent] scriptum super libros sententiarum petrilombardiensis (a commentary on peter lombard'ssentences [collection of opinions of the church fathers])[12537]. note that this remains untranslated save in smallexcerpts.[st] summa theologiae (a treatise on theology),parts i [12658], iii [12712], iiii [c.1271], iii [12723].[ver] quaestiones disputatae de veritate(disputed questions about truth) [12569].dyson, r. w.
