contributions california supply chain disclosure health care provider partnerships & payments commitment to human rights charters animal testing political contributions allergan recognizes that informed public policy is a critical factor in achieving its goal of pursuing medical advances to help patients live life to their fullest potential. allergan participates in the political process and supports those policies, candidates and organizations who work to advance healthcare innovation and improve patient access to needed medical treatments while also recognizing that a fair, free market system provides the best atmosphere for continued innovation. while federal law prohibits corporations from making political contributions to federal candidates, companies can establish political action committees that are funded solely through voluntary employee contributions. the allergan political action committee for employees (apace) was established to provide eligible employees a direct means to voluntarily participate in shaping sound public policy on issues related to allergan’s businesses. apace operates in accordance with all relevant federal and state laws and supports candidates from both parties. all apace contributions are publicly disclosed in reports available on the federal election commission’s web site at allergan retains independent experts to assist the company in complying with all applicable election and campaign laws. in certain jurisdictions where it is permitted, allergan makes corporate contributions to support election campaigns, party committees, and ballot measures. allergan supports candidates from both parties. beginning january 1, 2009 and on a semi-annual basis, allergan makes a list of all corporate state and local political contributions and independent expenditures, if any, supporting or opposing candidates, committees, political parties and ballot measures available via this website. allergan is a member of several industry and trade groups that represent both the pharmaceutical and the business community at large in an effort to bring about consensus on broad policy issues that can impact allergan’s business objectives and ability to help patients live life to their fullest potential. allergan’s participation as a member of these various industry and trade groups comes with the understanding that we may not always agree with the positions of the larger organization and/or other members, and we are committed to voicing our concerns as appropriate through our colleagues who serve on the boards and committees of these groups. click here for a partial listing of our current memberships. allergan has a code of business conduct and ethics that discourages employees from using corporate funds or assets for political purposes unless approved by the company’s government affairs department, legal department or compliance department. further, the corporate governance and compliance committee of allergan’s board of directors, which is comprised entirely of independent directors, annually reviews allergan’s political contributions, as well as its contribution policies and practices. in addition, apace’s board, which is generally comprised of employees who are apace participants, also assists allergan's government affairs department in selecting policies, candidates and organizations to support. when selecting candidates for funding, priority is given to candidates’ views on issues that concern allergan’s businesses and the presence of employees or facilities in such candidate’s state or district. questions regarding allergan’s political contributions, or how to become more involved in the policies that affect allergan, should be directed to allergan’s government affairs
