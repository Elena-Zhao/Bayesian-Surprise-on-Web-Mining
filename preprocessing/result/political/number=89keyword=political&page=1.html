"he's not one of them."another source close to romney puts it this way: "i wouldn't bet on it, but i wouldn't bet either."the key, these sources say, is that romney wants to see a republican candidate who can win the white house. so there's a willingness to wait to see who will run for the gop nomination. while these sources say that, as of today, it's not likely romney would run, it can't be ruled out entirely - and if the early seeding were to produce a weak field, romney might be in a position to be a late entrant. full story filed under: 2016mitt romney click to watch video september 29th, 2014 10:36 am et share this on: facebook twitter digg del.icio.us reddit myspace stumbleupon comments (add comment) 1 month ago mccain on rise of isis: 'we predicted this'posted bycnn's jeremy diamond sen. john mccain slammed president barack obama on monday over his comments that u.s. intelligence underestimated isis.mccain countered obama's assertions made on cbs' "60 minutes," saying that isis' expansion in syria and iraq was tied to the president's decision not to leave a residual u.s. military force in iraq and his refusal to arm moderate syrian rebels last year despite urgings from his national security advisers."we predicted this and watched it," mccain said on cnn's "new day."

"no matter how many of her advisors whisper to reporters that she's different from barack obama, americans still know who she is: barack obama part deux." full story filed under: 2016america risinghillary clinton september 22nd, 2014 09:58 am et share this on: facebook twitter digg del.icio.us reddit myspace stumbleupon comments (add comment) 1 month ago the secret weapon of iowa democrats: obamadaleposted bycnn national political reporter peter hamby for a small band of supercharged democratic organizers, the pleasant des moines neighborhood of beaverdale goes by another name: obamadale.the moniker was bestowed three years ago by a motley crew of democrats who first met as strangers over martinis at a local restaurant in the early days of president obama's re-election bid, brought together under the aegis of the "neighborhood team" model that defined the campaign's bottom-up volunteer structure.led by kimberley boggus, a bubbly 33-year-old nursing student, and sam reno, a 42-year-old no-nonsense construction crew supervisor, the platoon of volunteers eventually managed to turn out more than 700 democrats to their local caucus precinct on a chilly january night in 2012 - and that was for an uncontested race overwhelmingly won by obama. by november, in another show of force, "we turned out 87 percent of the democratic voters in beaverdale," boggus recalled with evident pride.after the campaign, obama's behemoth political organization became organizing for america (ofa), but the group has struggled to maintain a coherent identity outside the president's campaigns. full story filed under: 20142016ofa september 18th, 2014 02:59 pm et share this on: facebook twitter digg del.icio.us reddit myspace stumbleupon comments (add comment) 2 months ago chris christie accuses 'bridgegate' panel of playing politicsposted bycnn's steve kastenbaum new jersey gov. chris christie had harsh words thursday for the committee investigating allegations of abuse of power and the orchestrated lane closures at the george washington bridge, known to many as the "bridgegate" scandal."it's absolutely not true and it is a completely, a completely partisan act to be doing the leaking that they are doing," he said in response to a reporter's question about claims that his lawyers would not hand over certain documents, citing executive privilege.the governor lambasted democratic new jersey assemblyman john wisniewski, co-chairman of the select committee on investigation, saying he wanted to keep his name in the newspapers and his face on tv."we have fully cooperated, absolutely fully cooperated with them, and i am really growing tired of him," christie said at a news conference in trenton, new jersey. full story filed under: chris christie september 17th, 2014 10:56 am et share this on: facebook twitter digg del.icio.us reddit myspace stumbleupon comments (add comment) 2 months ago nra hopes to influence three key senate racesposted byby cnn senior producer kevin bohn the national rifle association will weigh in on three of this year's key senate races with a multimillion dollar ad buy beginning wednesday.the nra effort is aimed at boosting republican senate challengers in arkansas, colorado and north carolina - the outcomes of which could likely determine which party controls the chamber.the group's campaign is expected to top $4 million in these states, spokesman andrew arulanandam confirmed to cnn. it will spend $1.4 million to boost north carolina house speaker thom tillis, who is running against incumbent democrat sen. kay hagan."our second amendment rights are under attack by the obama administration, and we need leaders like thom tillis in the senate to fight back," states the ad. full story filed under: 2014nra september 16th, 2014 09:19 am et share this on: facebook twitter digg del.icio.us reddit myspace stumbleupon comments (add comment) 2 months ago democrats use romney strategy on scott brownposted byby cnn's ashley killough a new political ad against republican scott brown could easily have been an attack ad against mitt romney in 2012.one of the toughest spots to hit brown this cycle, the 30-second ad paints the former senator from massachusetts as a "yes man" to a large corporation that has outsourced jobs.while the ad never mentions romney, who campaigned for brown this summer, the outsourcing attack was a key strategy used by democrats two years ago when romney, a former private equity executive, was running for president. full story filed under: 2014mitt romneynew hampshirescott brown click to watch video september 15th, 2014 09:46 am et share this on: facebook twitter digg del.icio.us reddit myspace stumbleupon comments (add comment) 2 months ago clinton in iowa: fresh start or deja vu?posted bycnn national political reporter peter hamby "it's been seven years, and a lot has changed," hillary clinton said sunday in her first visit to iowa since the state dealt her presidential campaign a devastating body blow.but there was a moment in the afternoon when it seemed like not much had.roughly 200 credentialed media were gathered in a far corner of the indianola balloon field, the grassy expanse where sen. tom harkin was convening his 37th and final steak fry, an annual fundraiser that doubles as a point of entry for ambitious democrats curious about the iowa caucuses.after a 90-minute wait, the press scrum - scribblers and photographers alike - were herded like cattle through a series of gates and escorted up to a hot smoking grill, waiting to capture the same image: a staged shot of bill and hillary clinton, fresh out of their motorcade, ritualistically flipping steaks with harkin.the clintons ignored the half-hearted shouted questions from reporters - "mr. president, do you eat meat?" - with practiced ease. they were two football fields away from the nearest voter. mechanical, distant, heavy-handed: the afternoon spectacle felt a lot like hillary's 2008 caucus campaign, a succession of errors that crumbled under the weight of a feuding top-heavy staff and the candidate's inability to connect with her party's grassroots.and then the head fake -
