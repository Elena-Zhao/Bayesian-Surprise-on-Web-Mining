substantive revision thu aug 7, 2014to have a political obligation is to have a moral duty to obey thelaws of one's country or state. on that point there is almost completeagreement among political philosophers. but how does one acquire suchan obligation, and how many people have really done what is necessaryto acquire it? or is political obligation more a matter ofbeing than of doing that is, of simply beinga member of the country or state in question? to those questions manyanswers have been given, and none now commands widespread assent.indeed, a number of contemporary political philosophers deny that asatisfactory theory of political obligation either has been or can bedevised. others, however, continue to believe that there is a solutionto what is commonly called the problem of politicalobligation, and they are presently engaged in lively debate notonly with the skeptics but also with one another on the question ofwhich theory, if any, provides the solution to the problem.whether political obligation is the central or fundamental problem ofpolitical philosophy, as some have maintained (e.g., mcpherson), maywell be doubted. there is no doubt, however, that the history ofpolitical thought is replete with attempts to provide a satisfactoryaccount of political obligation, from the time of socrates to thepresent. these attempts have become increasingly sophisticated inrecent years, but they have brought us no closer to agreement on asolution to the problem of political obligation than the efforts of,say, thomas hobbes and john locke in the seventeenth century. nor havethese sophisticated attempts made it unnecessary to look back toearlier efforts to resolve the problem. on the contrary, anappreciation of the troublesome nature of political obligation seemsto require some attention to its place in the history of politicalthought.this essay begins, therefore, with a brief history of the problem ofpolitical obligation. it then turns, in part ii, to the conceptualquestions raised by political obligation, such as what it means for anobligation to be political. in part iii the focus ison the skeptics, with particular attention to the self-proclaimedphilosophical anarchists, who deny that political obligations existyet do not want to abolish the state. part iv surveys the leadingcontenders among the various theories of political obligation now onoffer, and part v concludes the essay with a brief consideration of recentproposals for pluralistic or multiple principleapproaches.1. political obligation in historical perspective 1.1 socrates on obeying the law 1.2 divine command 1.3 the social contract 1.4 utility and obligation 1.5 kant on legitimacy and obligation 2. conceptual matters 2.1 obligation and duty 2.2 obligation: political, civil, and legal 2.3 obligation, morality, and practical reason 3. anarchist challenges to political obligation 3.1 philosophical anarchism 3.2 against philosophical anarchism 4. contemporary theories of political obligation 4.1 consent 4.2 gratitude 4.3 fair play 4.4 membership or association 4.5 natural duty 5. conclusion: a plurality of principles?bibliographyacademic toolsother internet resourcesrelated entries1. political obligation in historical perspectivethe phrase political obligation is apparently no olderthan t. h. green's lectures on the principles of politicalobligation, delivered at oxford university in 187980(d'entrves, p. 3). the two words from which green formed thephrase are much older, of course, and he apparently thought thatcombining them required no elaborate explanation or defense. in anycase, there was nothing novel about the problem green addressed in hislectures: to discover the true ground or justification forobedience to law (green 1986, p. 13). sophocles raised thisproblem in his play antigone, first performed around 440 bce,and plato's crito recounts socrates' philosophical responseto the problem, in the face of his own death, some forty yearslater.1.1 socrates on obeying the lawin 399 bce an athenian jury found socrates guilty of impiety andcorrupting the morals of the youth, for which crimes the jurycondemned him to death. according to plato's account, socrates'friends arranged his escape, but he chose to stay and drink the fatalhemlock, arguing that to defy the judgment against him would be tobreak his agreements and commitments and tomistreat his friends, his country, and the laws ofathens (crito, 54c; trial and death, p. 54).socrates' arguments are sketchy, and crito, his interlocutor, doeslittle to challenge them, but they are nevertheless suggestive of thetheories of political obligation that have emerged in the two and ahalf millennia since his death.these arguments fall into four categories. first, socrates maintainsthat his long residence in athens shows that he has entered into anagreement with its laws and committed himself to obey them anargument that anticipates the social contract or consent theory ofpolitical obligation. second, he acknowledges that he owes his birth,nurture, and education, among other goods, to the laws of athens, andhe hints at the gratitude theory of obligation when he concludes thatit would be wrong of him to disobey its laws now. third, he appeals towhat is now known as the argument from fairness or fair play when hesuggests that disobedience would be a kind of mistreatment of hisfellow citizens. as he asks crito, if we leave here without thecity's permission, are we mistreating people whom we should leastmistreat? (50a) there is, finally, a trace of utilitarianreasoning, as when socrates imagines the laws and thestate confronting him with this challenge: do youthink it possible for a city not to be destroyed if the verdicts ofits courts have no force but are nullified and set at naught byprivate individuals? (50b). none of these arguments isfully developed, but their presence in the crito is testimonyto the staying power of intuitions and concepts commitment andagreement, gratitude, fair play, and utility that continue tofigure in discussions of obligation and obedience.plato's crito is noteworthy not only as the firstphilosophical exploration of political obligation but also as the lastto appear for centuries. the cynics and others did question the valueof political life, and indirectly the existence of an obligation toobey the law, but they left no record of a discussion of the subjectas sustained as even the five or six pages in the crito. whenthe morality of obedience and disobedience next became a muchdiscussed issue, it was a religious as much as a philosophicaldiscussion.1.2 divine commandthroughout history, the belief that political society and its rulesare divinely ordained has been so strong as to keep many people, andprobably most, from considering the possibility that disobeying thoserules might ever be justified. with the advent of christianity,however, that possibility had to be taken seriously. for thechristian, the distinction jesus draws (matthew 22:1522) between thetribute owed to caesar and that owed to god makes it clear that whatthe rulers command may be at odds with what god wants done. that pointbecame even clearer when the rulers tried to suppresschristianity. nevertheless, christian doctrine held that there is anobligation to obey the law grounded in divine command, with the mostimportant text being paul's epistle to the romans (13:12): forthere is no authority except from god, and those that exist have beeninstituted by god. therefore he who resists the authorities resistswhat god has appointed, and those who resist will incurjudgment.as a theory of political obligation, divine command faces two generalproblems. first, it presupposes the existence of divinity of somesort; and second, the commands of the divine being(s) are not alwaysclear. it is one thing to know that we should give to caesar what iscaesar's and to god what is god's, for example, and quite another toknow what exactly is caesar's due. for christians, however, the mainchallenge was to reconcile paul's text with the uncomfortable factthat rulers were often hostile to christianity or, with therise of protestantism in the sixteenth century, hostile to what onetook to be true christianity. to this challenge, one response wassimply to hold that hostile or vicious rulers must be endured, for godmust have given them power as a sign of his displeasure with a wickedpeople. other responses, though, made room for disobedience.one such response was to distinguish the divinely ordained office fromthe officer who occupied it. that is, god ordains that politicalauthority must exist, because the condition of human life since thefall from grace requires such authority; but god does not ordain thatthis or that particular person hold a position of authority, and hecertainly does not want rulers to abuse their authority by rulingtyrannically. this distinction, employed as early as the fourthcentury by st. john chrysostom, was invoked throughout the middle ages(mcilwain, pp. 15253). a second response to the problem romans 13posed was to distinguish disobedience from resistance. according tomartin luther and others who drew this distinction, christians may notactively resist their rulers, but they must disobey them when therulers' commands are contrary to god's. yet a third response was tonote the possibility of conflict between two or more of one's rulers.in other words, if more than one person holds political authority overyou, and if they issue conflicting commands, then you may satisfypaul's injunction by obeying the authority whose commands are morecongenial to your understanding of true christianity, even when suchobedience entails resisting the commands of others in authority.these last two responses played an especially important part in thepolitical disputes that accompanied the protestant reformation. underthe pressure of those disputes, however, another theory of politicalobligation became increasingly prominent, as protestants came to relyon the belief that political authority derives from the consent of thegoverned (skinner, vol. 2, chaps. 79).1.3 the social contractalthough the idea of the social contract long antedates the modern era(gough 1967), its full development occurred in the seventeenthcentury, when thomas hobbes and john locke used the theory to ratherdifferent ends. jean-jacques rousseau, immanuel kant, and otherphilosophers have also relied on social contract theory, but theclassic expressions of the contract theory of political obligationremain hobbes's leviathan (1651) and locke's secondtreatise of government (1690).for hobbes, social contract theory established the authority of anyonewho was able to wield and hold power. if we imagine ourselves in astate of nature, he argued, with no government and no law to guide usbut the law of nature, we will recognize that everyone is naturallyequal and independent. but we should also recognize that this state ofnature will also be a state of war, for the restlesse desirefor power after power that drives all of us will lead toa warre of every man against every man (hobbes,chaps. 11, 13). to escape so dreadful a condition, people surrendertheir independence by entering into a covenant to obey a sovereignpower that will have the authority to make, enforce, and interpretlaws. this form of the social contract hobbes calledsovereignty by institution. but he also insisted thatconquerors acquire authority over those they subject to their rule sovereignty by acquisition when theyallow those subjects to go about their business. in either case,hobbes said, the subjects consent to obey those who have effectivepower over them, whether the subject has a choice in who holds poweror not. because they consent, they therefore have an obligation toobey the sovereign, whether sovereignty be instituted or acquired.exactly how much locke differs from hobbes in his conclusions is amatter of scholarly dispute, but there is no doubt that he puts thesame concepts to work for what seem to be more limited ends. accordingto locke, the free and equal individuals in the state of natureestablish government as a way of overcoming theinconveniencies of that state. moreover, locke's socialcontract appears to have two stages. in the first stage the naturallyfree and equal individuals agree to form themselves into a politicalsociety, under law, and in the second they establish thegovernment. this move allows locke to argue, contrary to hobbes, for aright of revolution on the ground that overthrowing the governmentwill not immediately return the people to the state of nature. nordoes he hold, with hobbes, that mere submission to a conquerorconstitutes a form of consent to the conqueror's rule.locke does agree with hobbes, of course, in deriving obligations toobey the law from the consent of the governed. in developing hisargument, however, he reveals three problems that have bedeviledsocial contract theory. one problem has to do with the nature of thecontract: is it historical or hypothetical? if the former, then theproblem is to show that most people truly have entered into such acontract. if the contract is meant to be a device that illustrates howpeople would have given their consent, on the other hand,then the difficulty is that a hypothetical contract is nocontract at all (dworkin, 1977, p. 151). the second problem hasto do with the way hobbes and locke rely on tacit consent. ifonly express or explicit statements of agreement or commitment countas genuine consent, then it appears that relatively few people haveconsented to obey the laws of their country; but if tacit or impliedconsent is allowed, the concept of consent may be stretched toofar. hobbes does this when he counts submission to a conqueror asconsent, but locke also runs this risk when he states, in 119 ofthe second treatise, that the very being of anyonewithin the territories of a government amounts to tacitconsent. finally, it is not clear that consent is really the key topolitical obligation in these theories. the upshot of hobbes's theoryseems to be that we have an obligation to obey anyone who can maintainorder, and in locke's it seems that there are some things to which wecannot consent. in particular, we cannot consent to place ourselvesunder an absolute ruler, for doing so would defeat the very purposesfor which we enter the social contract to protect our lives,liberty, and property (pitkin 1965).one of the first to find fault with the argument from consent orcontract was david hume. in of the original contract,published in 1752, hume takes particular exception to the appeal totacit consent. to say, he protests, that most people have given theirconsent to obey the laws simply by remaining in their country of birthis tantamount to saying that someone tacitly consents to obey a ship'scaptain though he was carried on board while asleep and mustleap into the ocean and perish the moment he leaves her (1953,p. 51). for hume, it seems, the obligation to obey the law derives notfrom consent or contract but from the straightforward utility of asystem of laws that enables people to pursue their interestspeacefully and conveniently.1.4 utility and obligationfor all its influence in other areas of legal, moral, and politicalphilosophy, utilitarianism has found few adherents among those whobelieve that there is a general obligation to obey the laws of one'scountry. part of the reason for this situation may be the fact thatjeremy bentham, john stuart mill, and others who followed hume's pathhad little to say about political obligation. a more powerful reason,though, is that utilitarians have trouble accounting for obligationsof any kind. if one's guiding principle is always to act to maximizeexpected utility, or promote the greatest happiness of the greatestnumber, then obligations seem to have little or no bindingforce. after all, if i can do more good by giving the money in mypossession to charity than by paying my debts, then that is what ishould do, notwithstanding my obligations to my creditors. by the samereasoning, whether i should obey or disobey the law is a matter to besettled by considering which will do more good, not by determiningwhether i have an obligation to obey.some utilitarian philosophers have struggled to overcome this problem,either by pointing to reasons to believe that respecting obligationsserves to promote utility or by restricting calculations of utility torules or norms rather than to individual acts (see the entry onconsequentialism for details). whether their efforts have beensuccessful remains a matter of debate. there seems to be a consensus,however, that the most sophisticated attempts to provide a utilitariangrounding for political obligation, such as those of rolf sartorius(1975, chaps. 5 and 6) and r. m. hare (1976), have proved unsuccessful(e.g., simmons 1979, pp. 4554; horton 2010, pp. 6069). as a result,utilitarianism seldom figures in the debates of those contemporarypolitical philosophers who continue to believe that there is, in somepolitical societies, a general obligation to obey the law.1.5 kant on legitimacy and obligationin contrast to utilitarianism, the practical philosophy of aneighteenth-century german philosopher, immanuel kant, does play amajor part in contemporary debates about political obligation. theproper direction of his influence, however, is not altogether settled.on the one hand, a leading philosophical anarchist, robert paulwolff, claims kantian inspiration for his a priori rejection of thepossibility of political obligation (see 3.1, below); on theother hand, important exponents of the natural dutyapproach to the obligation to obey the law also claim to derive theirarguments from kant (see 4.5, below). kant may bear someresponsibility for fostering such divergent responses, but it is safeto say that he himself was no anarchist, not even of thephilosophical sort. indeed, he seems to insist on anunqualified obligation to obey the law that goes well beyond what anypolitical philosopher nowadays will countenance.kant's theory employs the same basic concepts as hobbes's and locke's natural (or innate) rights, the state of nature, and thesocial contract but he puts them to different use. incontrast to hobbes, kant looks upon the coercive force of the law notas a limitation on freedom but as the means of securing and extendingit. in the state of nature, as he conceives of it, individuals mayenjoy wild, lawless freedom, but the threats andconstraints imposed by others prevent them from freely acting on theirchoices (1991[1797], p. 127). justified coercion under law provides aremedy by impeding those who would interfere with one's actions,thereby hindering the hindrances to freedom (ripstein,pp. 5455 et passim). moreover, unlike locke'sjustification of the social contract as the way to secure one'sproperty and escape the inconveniencies of the state ofnature, kant takes the civil condition produced by thesocial contract to be the foundation that property rights and justicein general presuppose. the social contract is thus not a matter ofcollective consent but a moral imperative: when you cannotavoid living side by side with all others, you ought to leave thestate of nature and proceed with them into a rightful condition, thatis a condition of distributive justice (1991, pp. 12122).properly speaking, kant declares, the original contractis not an expression of consent to be governed; it is the ideaof this act, in terms of which alone we can think of the legitimacy ofa state (1991, p. 127).the upshot, as noted above, is that everyone seems to have an absoluteobligation to obey the laws of whoever is in authority; for even ifthe ruler proceeds contrary to law subjects may indeedoppose this injustice by complaints but not byresistance (1991, p. 130, emphasis in original; alsopp. 17677). kant's comments on this point are not unqualified,though. among other things, he states that the spiritof the original contract involves an obligation on the part ofthe constituting authority to make the kind of governmentsuited to the idea of the original contract; and he immediatelyadds that the only constitution that accords with rightis that of a pure republic that is, theconstitution in which law itself rules and depends on noparticular person (1991, p. 148, emphases in original; forfurther discussion, see ripstein, chap. 11). in any case, it is notso much kant's conclusions as the foundations of his theory that haveproved so important to contemporary discussions of politicalobligation.2. conceptual mattersin the twentieth century political philosophers devoted themselves atleast as much to the analysis of the problem of political obligation,and to the concepts it involves, as to full-scale attempts to devisetheories of the obligation to obey the law. some even argued that theexistence of political obligations could be established by conceptualanalysis alone a point we return to in 3. more oftenphilosophers working in this vein sought to clarify what was at issuein the assertion or denial of political obligations,or duties to obey the law.2.1 obligation and dutyas the previous sentence suggests, obligations are also duties. thatis true, at any rate, when the obligation in question is politicalobligation. to be sure, some philosophers have uncovered differencesbetween obligations and duties, the most important of which is thatobligations must be voluntarily undertaken or incurred, but dutiesneed not be (e.g., brandt 1964; hart 1958). the obligation to keep apromise or fulfill a contract, for example, arises only when one hasdone something that generates the obligation made a promise orsigned a contract but the duties of charity and truth tellingsupposedly fall on us regardless of what, if anything, we voluntarilycommit to do. john rawls relies on this distinction when he arguesthat most citizens of a reasonably just political society have nogeneral obligation to obey its laws, even though they do have anatural duty to support just institutions a dutythat has the general effect of requiring them to obey (rawls 1999,p. 97). for the most part, however, the distinction between obligationand duty has played no significant role in the debates over thesupposed moral responsibility to obey the law. to invoke thedistinction here would run counter to the tendency in both ordinarylanguage and philosophical discussion to use the termsinterchangeably, as when we speak of the duty to keep apromise or an obligation to tell the truth. this essay will proceed, then,like almost everything written on either side of the question, on theunderstanding that a political obligation, if it exists, is a moralduty to obey the law (but note the elaboration of this point in 2.3, below).2.2 obligation: political, civil, and legalone question that immediately arises from this conception ofpolitical obligation is whether political is the appropriatemodifer. if the obligation in question is a duty to obey thelaw, ceteris paribus, then why not call it a legalobligation? or why not conclude, with bhikhu parekh (1993, p. 240),that the question of whether we have a duty to obey the law is reallya matter of civil obligation that is, the obligationto respect and uphold the legitimately constituted civil authority that entails legal obligations to obey the lawsenacted by the civil authority rather than political obligation?political is the broader term, according to parekh, and someone whohas a truly political obligation will owe her polity more than mereobedience to its laws (see also raz 2006, p. 1004). such a person willhave a positive duty to take steps to secure the safety and advancethe interests of her country. following parekh's distinction, then,we may say that someone who pays taxes discharges a legal obligation,no matter how grudgingly she pays them, but someone who paystaxes and contributes voluntarily to public projects fulfillsa truly political obligation.other philosophers also distinguish political from legal obligations,but not in the far-reaching way that parekh does. indeed, it seemsthat we already have a term, civic duty, that does the work he wantsto assign to political obligation. exhortations to do our civicduty typically urge us to do more than merely obey the law. theseexhortations would have us vote in elections and be well-informedvoters; buy government bonds; limit our use of water and other scarceresources; donate blood, service, or money (beyond what we owe intaxes) in times of crisis; and generally contribute in an active wayto the common good. whether we really have a civic duty to do any orall of these things may be a matter of dispute, but appeals to civicduty are certainly quite common, and it is hardly clear that there issomething to be gained by reclassifying them as appeals to politicalobligation.rather than political obligation or parekh's civil obligation, whynot call the duty to obey the law a legal obligation? theanswer seems to be that legal obligation has a different kind ofwork to do. for many legal philosophers, the claim that a person hasa legal obligation to do x is merely a descriptive claim, a statementof social fact. the fact that a person has a legal obligation to do xprovides him with a moral reason to do x only if he has a moral dutyto obey the law that is, a political obligation. the value ofthis distinction is that it allows one to hold that a person may besubject to a legal obligation even though she has no politicalobligation to obey the laws of the regime in power. suppose that theregime is tyrannical, inept, or simply so unjust that only a hobbesianwould maintain that those subject to its commands have a moralobligation to obey. nevertheless, most theorists will agree thatpeople in this unhappy country have legal obligations to pay taxes,refrain from certain types of conduct when driving, and do whateverthe legal system that enjoys de facto jurisdiction over them requires;that is, claims to this effect are true descriptions of the world.but such descriptions are compatible with the belief that the peopleof unhappy countries have no moral duty to act as the law directssimply because the law so directs.a closely related question is whether we should distinguish theconcept of political obligation from that of a duty to obey the law.the answer may depend on whether we understand the term political torefer to the status in virtue of which a person has the obligation orto the entity or agent to whom she owes it. in the former case,political obligation refers to those obligations a person has as amember or citizen of a particular polity. so understood, a theory ofpolitical obligation will tell us nothing about the authority a stateenjoys over non-members; for example, whether and why short-termvisitors residing on its territory have a duty to obey its laws. thatneed not render it defective as an account of political obligation,but it does entail that we should not take the phrase politicalobligation to be synonymous with the phrase a duty to obey thelaw simpliciter, but only with the phrase a citizen's (ormember's) duty to obey the law. in contrast, if political refersto the agent or entity to whom a person owes the obligation, then atheory of political obligation will be synonymous with a theory of theduty to obey the law, since it will aspire to explain why those whoare subject to a particular state's jurisdiction, be they citizens orforeigners, have a moral duty to act as it directs them to act.arguably, certain solutions to the problem of political obligationfare better when political refers to the status in virtue of which aperson has the obligation than when it refers to the entity to whichshe owes it, or vice versa. for example, membership (or associative)approaches to political obligation may have a leg up in justifyingcitizens' duties to obey the law but face a significant challenge inaccounting for the obligation of foreigners to do so (see4.4). conversely, natural duty theories may be able to explainwhy anyone, citizen or not, has a duty to obey the law (i.e., the lawsof one or another legal system) but struggle to explain why anyone hasa duty to obey the laws of the particular state of which she is amember (see the discussion of particularity at the end of 2.3;see also 4.5). attention to the ambiguity in the referent ofthe term political may also support a pluralistic ormultiprinciple solution to the problem of political obligation;e.g., a membership justification for the duty of citizens to obey thelaw, and a consent justification for the duty of foreigners to do so(see 5).2.3 obligation, morality, and practical reasonas in the five historically significant theories surveyed in theprevious section, the presumption that the answer to the problem ofpolitical obligation must be stated in moral terms has continued toprevail. when t. h. green set out in 1879 to discover the trueground or justification for obedience to law, for example, hewas looking for more than prudence alone can provide. youought to obey the law because you will suffer if you do not maybe a powerful reason for obedience, but it is not a reason that speaksto green's concern with the moral function or object served bylaw (1986, p. 13). for green, and for almost everyoneelse who has pondered it, the problem of political obligation is amoral problem, and the obligation in question is a kind of moralobligation. to have a political obligation, then, is to have a moralduty to obey the law.margaret gilbert has recently challenged this moralizedcharacterization of political obligation (gilbert 2006; gilbert 2013).she maintains that a political obligation is a genuine obligation, bywhich she means that it provides a person subject to it with asufficient, though not necessarily conclusive, reason for action thattrumps considerations of inclination or self-interest. however,gilbert distinguishes between two kinds of genuine obligations, or twosenses of the term obligation, the first synonymous with being thesubject of a moral requirement and the second with owing somethingto another (2013, pp. 39192). obligation in this second sensedescribes a normative relationship between two or more parties, onethat can be created via a suitable act of will; for example, by whatgilbert calls an exercise of joint commitment. it is the second senseof obligation that gilbert maintains we ought to employ in ouranalysis of the problem of political obligation, understood here asthe challenge of accounting for the obligations people owe one anotheras co-members of a given polity. that does not preclude thedevelopment of a theory concerning when moral requirements outweigh ordefeat people's political obligations, of course. as she sees it,though, the theory of political obligation itself ought to bede-moralized.one upshot of gilbert's account is that it entirely separates theexistence of political obligations from the justice or injustice ofthe political society's institutions and laws. on her account,individuals can acquire genuine obligations in the sense of owingsomething to another even when their suitable act of willing iscoerced or the content of what they agree to owe another is immoral.with respect to political obligations, then, neither state coercion(i.e., the absence of voluntary consent) nor the injustice of astate's laws or institutions precludes its citizens' acquisition of agenuine obligation to obey its laws. but why think that a promiseextracted at gunpoint generates any reason to do that which onepromised, or that a voluntary agreement to torture babies generates agenuine (albeit not conclusive) obligation to do so? or, if coercedor immoral owing-obligations are genuine but always defeated ortrumped by moral-requirement-obligations, one might wonder why weshould posit their separate existence at all. one possibility is thatdoing so is necessary to render intelligible the response of thepromisee when the coerced promisor reneges on her promise; we canunderstand why the promisee feels betrayed even if we do not think heis justified in feeling that way. this response, however, treatsgilbert's account of political obligation as an explanatory theory,not a justificatory one (lefkowitz 2007; for a response, see gilbert2013, pp. 40607).gilbert aside, theorists of political obligation characterize it as amoral duty to obey the law. as such, it provides a person with acategorical reason for action, one that does not depend on herinclinations or self-interest. political obligation is also typicallyunderstood to be content-independent; that is, to be a dutyto obey the law as such, or simply because it is the law (hart 1982,pp. 25455). where a person has a duty to obey the law, the judgmentthat the law requires her to x suffices to provide her with a reasonto x, independent of any judgment she may make regarding the merits ofperforming x. the problem of political obligation, then, is notsimply the question of whether a person has a reason to do that whichthe law would have her do. often a person will have prudentialreasons to do so, and she may have moral obligations to perform or notperform specific acts independent of their being legally required orproscribed, as in the case of forbearing from murder. rather, thequestion concerns the conditions, if any, in which the fact that thelaw requires a person to act thus-and-so imposes a moral obligation onher to act as the law directs. the content-independence of politicalobligation reflects the fact that what stands in need of justificationis the polity's right to its subjects' obedience to theiracting as it directs because it so directs them.how can the state's mere willing that a person be required to performa certain act create a moral obligation to do so? though afew theorists have attempted to address this challenge head on,gilbert being the most recent, most construe claims to authority notas the creation of moral obligations ex nihilo but as a moralobligation to defer to the state's judgment regarding what they haveindependent reason to do (but compare klosko 2011). thecharacterization of this deference within a person's deliberation is amatter of some dispute. h. l. a. hart and joseph raz, for example,argue that law is preemptive; law does not merely offer aconsideration for or against a potential course of action, to beweighed against any and all other relevant considerations. rather,law aims to exclude from an agent's deliberation at least some of theconsiderations favoring or opposing the conduct at issue,considerations that in the absence of the law it would be permissibleto take into account (raz 1979, chaps. 1 and 2). rival views of themanner in which political obligation functions in a person'sdeliberation reject the exclusionary element of raz's account of theduty to obey the law, arguing that political obligations are simplyweighty moral reasons that are balanced against all of the otherreasons a person has to perform or not perform a given act (perry1989). on neither account, though, is a person's political obligationtaken to provide her with an absolute duty to obey the law. raz, forexample, notes that law need not exclude all of the firstorderreasons a person might have for performing a given act (raz 1986,p. 46). nor does he claim that the first-order reason the lawprovides for not performing a given act will always outweigh or defeatnon-excluded first-order reasons a person has to perform that act. inother words, the duty to obey the law is a prima facieor pro tanto reason for action, from which it follows thatthe bearer of a political obligation may not always have a conclusiveor all-things-considered reason to act as the law demands.theorists of political obligation typically ascribe two furtherfeatures to the moral duty they seek to defend. first, the duty toobey the law is general both in the sense that it is a dutyto obey the entire body of law in a given jurisdiction and in thesense that the duty is borne by all those living within thatjurisdiction. note that a general moral duty to obey the law isconsistent with variation in the legal obligations different subjectsbear. for example, a given state may impose on all and only its malecitizens a duty to register for a military draft, in which case thefull set of legal obligations borne by men in this state will differfrom the full set borne by women. nevertheless, citizens of bothsexes may be subject to a general political obligation, meaning thatthey have a moral duty to fulfill all of their legal obligations.raz, however, denies that the subjects of any existing state or indeedanything remotely like it have a general duty to obey the law; rather,law's authority is piecemeal, both with respect to who has a moralduty to obey a particular law and with respect to the number of lawswithin a given legal system that enjoy authority over anyone.the second feature commonly ascribed to political obligations is thatthey are owed only to the particular political/legal societythat claims primary or exclusive jurisdiction over a person.following john simmons's influential analysis, this has come to beknown as the particularity requirement. politicalobligation, simmons maintains, carries an implicit connection tocitizenship, which means that those who are engaged in the politicalobligation debate are only interested in those moralrequirements [including obligations and duties] which bind anindividual to one particular political community, set ofinstitutions, etc. (1979, p. 31, emphasis in original; butcf. edmundson 2004, p. 232, and walton 2013). as indicated below, in4.5, the main objection to natural duty theories of politicalobligation is that they cannot account for this particularity.3. anarchist challenges to political obligationaccording to the foregoing analysis, a political obligation, if itexists at all, is at least a systemic, prima facie or protanto moral duty to obey the laws of one's polity. but does suchan obligation exist or obtain in any general or widespread sense? mostpolitical philosophers have assumed that the answer is yes. in themiddle years of the twentieth century some philosophers even asserted,on conceptual grounds, that political obligation needs nojustification. as one of them put the point,to ask why i shouldobey any laws is to ask whether there might be a political societywithout political obligations, which is absurd. for we mean bypolitical society, groups of people organized according to rulesenforced by some of their number (macdonald, p. 192; alsomcpherson, p. 64, and, more subtly, pitkin 1966; but cf. pateman 1973,and horton 2010, pp. 13846). this view did not long prevail,but it testifies to the strength of the tendency to believe thatcitizens surely have an obligation to obey the laws of their country,at least if it is reasonably just.there have been dissenters, however, and in recent years they havecome to occupy a prominent place among political philosophers. as theysee it, there is no general obligation to obey the law, not even onthe part of the citizens of a reasonably just polity. the mostthorough-going of these dissenters have been anarchists proper that is, those persons who insist that states and governments arewickedly coercive institutions that ought to be abolished. yet otherskeptics or dissenters have concluded that the anarchist proper iswrong about the need for the state but right about the obligation toobey the law. like the anarchist proper, these philosophicalanarchists hold that the state is illegitimate, but they denythat its illegitimacy entails a strong moral imperative tooppose or eliminate states; rather they typically take stateillegitimacy simply to remove any strong moral presumption in favor ofobedience to, compliance with, or support for our own or otherexisting states (simmons 2001, p. 104; but note huemer 2013,who regards philosophical anarchism as a second-best alternative thatcould prepare the way for anarchism proper).3.1 philosophical anarchismthe arguments of these philosophical anarchists take either ana priori or an a posteriori form (simmons2001, pp. 104106). arguments of the first kind maintain that it isimpossible to provide a satisfactory account of a general obligationto obey the law. according to robert paul wolff, the principaladvocate of this view, there can be no general obligation to obey thelaw because any such obligation would violate the primaryobligation of autonomy, which is the refusal to beruled (1998 [1970], p. 18). as wolff defines it, autonomycombines freedom with responsibility. to be autonomous, someone musthave the capacity for choice, and therefore for freedom; but theperson who has this capacity also has the responsibility to exerciseit to act autonomously. failing to do so is to fail to fulfillthis primary obligation of autonomy.this primary obligation dooms any attempt to develop a theory ofpolitical obligation, wolff argues, except in the highly unlikely caseof a direct democracy in which every law has the unanimous approval ofthe citizenry. under any other form of government, autonomy andauthority are simply incompatible. authority is the right tocommand, and correlatively, the right to be obeyed (p. 4),which entails that anyone subject to authority has an obligation toobey those who have the right to be obeyed. but if we acknowledge suchan authority, we allow someone else to rule us, thereby violating ourfundamental obligation to act autonomously. we must therefore rejectthe claim that we have an obligation to obey the orders of those whopurport to hold authority over us and conclude that there can be nogeneral obligation to obey the laws of any polity that falls short ofa unanimous direct democracy.arguments of the second, a posteriori form are more modest in theiraims but no less devastating in their conclusions. in this case theaim is not to show that a satisfactory defense of political obligationis impossible but that no defense has proven satisfactory, despite theefforts of some of the best minds in the history of philosophy. allsuch attempts have failed, according to those who take this line, sowe must conclude that only those relatively few people who haveexplicitly committed themselves to obey the law, perhaps by swearingallegiance as part of an oath of citizenship, have anything like ageneral obligation to obey the laws under which they live (e.g., smith1973; raz 1979, chap. 12; simmons 1979 and 2001, chap. 6, and 2005; green 1988,pp. 22047, and 1996).3.2 against philosophical anarchismwhether a priori or a posteriori, the arguments of the philosophicalanarchists pose a serious challenge to those who continue to believein a general obligation to obey the law. this challenge is madeespecially difficult by the powerful objections that simmons and othera posteriori anarchists have brought against the existing theories ofpolitical obligation. the most effective response, of course, would beto demonstrate that one's favored theory does not succumb to theseobjections, and we shall briefly consider attempts to respond in thisfashion in the following section. some general attempts to refutephilosophical anarchism ought to be noted first, however.some of these attempts apply specifically to wolff's a priori attackon political authority and obligation, while others apply tophilosophical anarchism in general. the arguments against wolffusually concentrate on his conception of autonomy and its relation toauthority. in brief, wolff's critics argue that he is wrong to insistthat moral autonomy is our primary or fundamentalobligation, for it is, in fact, highly implausible tothink that autonomy should invariably override all other values (horton 2010, p. 129). moreover, there is no reason to acceptwolff's claim that autonomy and authority are necessarilyincompatible. insofar as autonomy is a capacity, as wolff says, itwill need to be developed before it can be exercised, and variouskinds of authority including political authority willfoster its development and make its continued exercise possible(dagger 1997, pp. 6668). nor is it clear how wolff can rejectpolitical authority without also rejecting promises and contracts asillegitimate constraints on one's autonomy a problem thatleads even simmons to judge wolff's a priori philosophical anarchism afailed attempt (2001, p. 111).in the face of these problems, matthew noah smith has recently triedto rescue the a priori skepticism of wolff's theory by substitutingthe overriding importance of the moral status of the subject'sself (2011, p. 2) for wolff's reliance on the fundamental dutyof autonomy. according to smith, preserving the status of the self isincompatible with the law's claim to authority, because theobligation to obey the law would morally require otherwise morallyupstanding subjects to undergo a radical form of self-effacement infavor of recreating themselves in the image of foreign values(p. 2; see p. 9 for an admittedly florid way of making this point).whether the law is properly understood as an alien forcethat threatens to fix who one is (p. 14), however, is apoint that critics of a priori anarchism are not likely to concede.indeed, the radically individualistic conception of the self thatunderpins smith's argument is one that proponents of the membership orassociative theory of political obligation (see 4.4, below) willdismiss from the outset. it seems unlikely, then, that smith'sadaptation will develop the traction that, on his account, wolff'shas failed to gain.with regard to philosophical anarchism in general, critics haveresponded in various ways, including the disparate complaints that itis a kind of false or hypocritical radicalism (gans) and that it isall too genuine a threat to political order (senor). the lattercomplaint has both an ontological and a conceptual aspect. that is,the critics argue that philosophical anarchists fail to appreciate thesocial or embedded nature of human beings, which leads the anarchiststo conceive of obligation in excessively individualistic orvoluntaristic terms which leads, in turn, to their denial of ageneral obligation to obey the law. the problem, however, is that itis a mistake to think that political life is left more or lessunchanged by dispensing with some conception of political obligationand adopting the perspective of philosophical anarchism. unless it canbe shown that we can continue to talk intelligibly and crediblyof our government or our state, then a radicalrethinking of our political relations is an unavoidableconsequence (horton 2010, p. 133). whether the philosophicalanarchists are willing to accept that consequence and perhapsto become anarchists proper or whether they can find a way tostop short of it thus becomes a major point of contention.in the end, of course, the best response to philosophical anarchists,especially those of the a posteriori kind, will be to produce ordefend a theory of political obligation that proves to be immune totheir objections. at present, though, no single theory has the supportof all of those who continue to believe in political obligation, letalone the assent of philosophical anarchists. several theories remainin contention, however, as the following section will attest.4. contemporary theories of political obligationalthough the lines that separate one theory from another are notalways distinct, philosophical justifications of political obligationnowadays usually take the form of arguments from consent, gratitude,fair play, membership, or natural duty. some philosophers advance ahybrid of two or more of these approaches, and others hold, as theconcluding section shows, that a pluralistic theory is necessary. forthe most part, though, attempts tojustify a general obligation to obey the law will rely on one of thesefive lines of argument.4.1 consentmost people who believe they have an obligation to obey the lawprobably think that this putative obligation is grounded in theirconsent. political philosophers are less inclined to think this way,however, in light of the withering criticism to which hume and morerecent writers notably simmons (1979, chaps. 3 and 4) have subjected consent theory. the critics' claim is not that consentcannot be a source of obligations, for they typically believe itcan. their claim, instead, is that too few people have eitherexpressly or tacitly given the kind of actual consent that can grounda general obligation to obey the law, and hypothetical consent cannotsupply the defect, for reasons already noted.nevertheless, consent theory still has its adherents among politicalphilosophers. their versions of consent theory vary considerably,however, with two main approaches emerging in response to thecriticisms. one, advanced by harry beran ( 1987), accepts the claimthat only express consent can generate a political obligation, butcalls for political societies to establish formal procedures forevoking such consent. that is, states should require their membersopenly to undertake an obligation to obey the law or to refuse to doso. those who decline the obligation will then have the options ofleaving the state, seceding to form a new state with like-mindedpeople, or taking residence in a territory within the state reservedfor dissenters. in the absence of such procedures, it seems thatberan's position is roughly the same as that of the a posterioriphilosophical anarchist. were these procedures in place, though, it isfar from clear that the options available to the members will maketheir consent truly voluntary (horton 2010, pp. 3436;klosko 2005, pp. 12329).the second line of response to criticisms of consent theory is toargue in one way or another that the critics construeconsent too narrowly. thus john plamenatz (1968,postscript) and peter steinberger (2004, p. 218) have maintained thatvoting or otherwise participating in elections should count asconsent; and steinberger produces a lengthy list of fairly ordinaryactivities calling the police or fire department for help,sending children to a public school, using a public library, and more that constitute active participation in theinstitutions of the state (2004, pp. 21920). mark murphyand margaret gilbert have sounded variations on this theme by arguing,in murphy's case, that surrender of judgment is a kind ofconsent (in edmundson 1999, p. 320), or, in gilbert's, thatjoint commitment is an important source of obligations,including political obligations (1993, 2006, 2013). for murphy,surrender of judgment is consent in the usual sense of voluntaryagreement or acceptance. as he says, one consents to another ina certain sphere of conduct in the acceptance sense of consent whenone allows the other's practical judgments to take the place of his orher own with regard to that sphere of conduct. (this consent may beeither to a person or to a set of rules: both of these can beauthoritative) (1999, p. 330). as the earlier discussion of herviews indicates 2.3, gilbert differs from murphy, and others, intaking a joint commitment to be something that need not arisevoluntarily. according to her theory, an understanding of jointcommitment and a readiness to be jointly committed are necessary ifone is to accrue political obligations, as is common knowledge ofthese in the population in question. one can, however, fulfill theseconditions without prior deliberation or decision, and if one hasdeliberated, one may have had little choice but to incur them(2006, p. 290). indeed, membership in a plural subjectformed through nonvoluntary joint commitments plays such a large partin gilbert's theory that it may be better to place her with those whoadvocate an associative or membership theory of political obligationthan with the adherents of consent theory.david estlund (2008, pp. 11758) has recently offered a new twist onconsent theory. most theorists, he observes, maintain that putativeacts of consent are void if it would be wrong to consent to someone'sauthority. for example, consent to be another person's slave generatesno obligation even if it genuinely expresses a person's will. estlundargues on grounds of symmetry that we ought to draw the sameconclusion in cases where it would be wrong not to consent toanother person's authority. such failures are void, and so a personwho morally ought to have consented to another's authority has a dutyto obey her. if subjects of a given state ought to consent to obeyits laws, say because the state performs morally necessary tasks, thentheir failure to do so is void and no barrier to concluding that theyare under a political obligation to that state. estlund's defense ofwhat he labels normative consent is subtle and sophisticatedin ways we cannot indicate here. still, in cases where non-consent isvoid, one might wonder whether the duty to submit to another'sauthority follows directly from the consideration in virtue of whichit is wrong for someone not to consent (see sreenivasan 2009). it isalso unclear whether there is enough of a connection between theagent's will and her coming to be subject to another's authority towarrant classifying estlund's account as an example of consent theory(for responses to both concerns, see estlund 2008, pp. 12731;2009).at this time there is little reason to believe that the critics ofconsent theory will be won over by these attempts to revive the theoryby broadening our understanding of what counts as consent. there iseven less reason, however, to believe that appeals to consent willsimply wither away, at least among those who continue to believe inthe existence of a general obligation to obey the law.4.2 gratitudeappeals to gratitude in debates about political obligation are as oldas plato's crito, as we have seen, and they remain populartoday. they are rarely, though, the sole or even primary basis for anattempt to justify the obligation to obey the law. plato's account ofsocrates' reasoning is typical in this regard, with gratitude beingbut one of at least four considerations socrates relies on inexplaining why he will not disobey the ruling of the jury thatsentenced him to death. (for more recent examples, see simmons 1979,pp. 16263.) when simmons included a chapter on the weakness ofgratitude as a foundation for political obligation in hisinfluential moral principles and political obligations(1979), in fact, there was no gratitudetheory on which to concentrate his criticism.that situation changed within a decade when a. d. m. walker sketchedsuch a theory in political obligation and the argument fromgratitude. walker's argument takes the following form (1988, p.205):the person who benefits from x has an obligation ofgratitude not to act contrary to x's interests.every citizen has received benefits from the state.every citizen has an obligation of gratitude not to act in waysthat are contrary to the state's interests.noncompliance with the law is contrary to the state'sinterests.every citizen has an obligation of gratitude to comply with thelaw.whether this argument does indeed provide the basis for a satisfactorytheory of political obligation seems to turn on two points. first, areobligations of gratitude at all pertinent where politicalinstitutions are concerned? walker holds that one may have anobligation of gratitude not only to other persons but also toinstitutions, including the state or polity; but critics such assimmons disagree (1979, pp. 18788; 2005, pp. 11920).gratitude is owed only to those who intentionally and at significantcost to themselves provide us with benefits, according to simmons, andinstitutions cannot satisfy these conditions. the second pointconcerns the strength of obligations of gratitude. that is, one maygrant that we can have obligations to institutions, including thestate, yet hold that these obligations are too weak to functionas prima facie political obligations in the usual sense, forthey would be overridden frequently, not just in unusualcircumstances (klosko 1989, p. 355). walker, in response,points to socrates as someone who obviously thought his obligation ofgratitude was very strong indeed, and concludes that we canafford to acknowledge that the extent of our indebtedness to the stateis less than his, while still insisting that it grounds a strong,though not absolute, obligation of gratitude to comply with thelaw (1989, p. 364; see also mcconnell 1993, pp. 180208,and, more critically, wellman 1999).4.3 fair playalthough earlier philosophers, including socrates, appealed tosomething resembling the principle of fairness (or fair play), theclassic formulation of the principle is the one h. l. a. hart gave itin are there any natural rights? as hart there says,when a number of persons conduct any joint enterprise accordingto rules and thus restrict their liberty, those who have submitted tothese restrictions when required have a right to a similar submissionfrom those who have benefited by their submission (1955,p. 185). john rawls subsequently adopted this principle in aninfluential essay of his own, referring to the duty derived from theprinciple as the duty of fair play (1964). what theprinciple of fair play holds, then, is that everyone who participatesin a reasonably just, mutually beneficial cooperative practice hart's joint enterprise according to rules hasan obligation to bear a fair share of the burdens of the practice.this obligation is owed to the others who cooperate in the enterprise,for cooperation is what makes it possible for any individual to enjoythe benefits of the practice. anyone who acts as a free rider isacting wrongly, then, even if his or her shirking does not directlythreaten the existence or success of the endeavor. those whoparticipate in the practice thus have rights against as well asobligations to one another: a right to require others to bear theirshare of the burdens and an obligation to bear one's share inturn.the principle of fair play applies to a political society only if itsmembers can reasonably regard it as a cooperative enterprise. if theycan, the members have an obligation of fair play to do their part inmaintaining the enterprise. because the rule of law is necessary tothe maintenance of such a polity and perhaps even constitutiveof it the principal form of cooperation is abiding by thelaw. in the absence of overriding considerations, then, the members ofthe polity qua cooperative practice must honor theirobligation to one another to obey the laws. in this way the principleof fair play provides the grounding for a general obligation to obeythe law, at least on the part of those whose polity they canreasonably regard as a cooperative enterprise.the argument from fair play has met with serious criticism, however,including that of rawls, who abandoned fair play as an account ofpolitical obligation for citizens generally in a theory ofjustice (p. 97, p. 308). the most sweeping criticism is that ofrobert nozick, who objects that the principle of fair play would allowothers to place us under an obligation to them simply by conferringbenefits on us (1974, pp. 9095). to make his point, nozickimagines a group of neighbors creating a public entertainment systemand assigning every adult in the neighborhood a day on which he or sheis responsible for planning and broadcasting the program. as aresident of the neighborhood, you occasionally hear and enjoy theprograms, but you never consent to take part in this scheme. when yourassigned day arrives, are you obligated to take a turn? the principleof fair play says yes, according to nozick, but the correct answer issurely not.a second objection, raised by m. b. e. smith, is that theobligation of fair play governs a man's actions only when some benefitor harm turns on whether he obeys (in edmundson 1999,p. 81). this implies that the principle of fair play will generate anobligation to cooperate only when the cooperative enterprise is smallenough that any participant's failure to obey the rules couldreasonably be expected to damage the enterprise. political societiesare not small, cooperative enterprises, however, and we can readilythink of cases in which someone's disobedience neither deprives anyoneof any benefits nor harms the polity in any noticeable way. itfollows, then, that the principle of fair play cannot ground a generalobligation to obey the law, however useful it may be in othercircumstances.according to a third objection, fair play considerations apply only tocooperative schemes that produce benefits one may refuse. if itproduces nonexcludable goods, which everyone receivesregardless of whether she contributed to their production or evenwants them, then there can be no fair-play obligation to bear a shareof the burdens of the enterprise. but this is typically the case inpolitical societies, which produce goods such as public order andnational defense that one cannot meaningfully refuse to accept. assimmons puts it (1979, p. 129), there is a differencebetween receiving and accepting benefits, and merelyreceiving them is not enough to place someone under an obligation. ifthere is a political obligation, therefore, it does not followdirectly from the existence of the kind of nonexcludable goods thatstates provide. to be sure, simmons does acknowledge that some peoplemay acquire fair-play obligations by enjoying nonexcludable benefitsthat they take to be worth the price [they] pay for themif they do so in full awareness that the benefits areprovided by a cooperative scheme (1979, p. 132, emphasis inoriginal). but he also maintains that few people will satisfy both ofthese conditions, with the second proving especially troublesome foradvocates of fairplay theory; for even in democraticpolitical communities, these benefits are commonly regarded aspurchased (with taxes) from a central authority rather than asaccepted from the cooperative efforts of our fellow citizens(1979, p. 139).as one might expect, advocates of the fair-play account have notremained silent in the face of these criticisms. the leading advocate,george klosko, has written two books elaborating and defending theprinciple of fairness as the foundation of political obligation (2004[1992], 2005), and it sometimes seems that every fresh attack on fairplay provokes a swift response (e.g., carr 2002 and lefkowitz2004). and the attacks have certainly continued (e.g., simmons 2001,chap. 2; mcdermott 2004), as we shall indicate shortly. first, though,it is necessary to see how fair-play advocates have responded to thethree criticisms sketched above.with regard to nozick's objection, the response is usually to holdthat his example of the neighborhood entertainment system is besidethe point (bell 1978). that is, nozick is probably right to say thatone would have no obligation to operate the system on his or herassigned day, but he is wrong to think fair play would require one todo so. there is no fair play obligation in cases such as this, eitherbecause the passive receipt of benefits is not enough to show that oneis a participant in a cooperative practice (dagger 1997,pp. 6970) or because the benefits are of relativelylittle value (klosko 2004, pp. 3839). to smith'sobjection, the response is that fairness is not a consideration onlywhen harm or benefit to some person or practice is involved. to failto do one's part in a cooperative enterprise is to wrongthose who cooperate even when it does not clearly harm either them orthe enterprise as such (dagger 1997, p. 71). responses to simmons' objection have taken two directions. one is tosay that simmons has drawn too sharp a distinction between theacceptance and receipt of benefits. between the person who passivelyreceives the benefits of a cooperative practice and the one whoknowingly and willingly accepts them is the person very manypeople, in fact who actively participates in the practicewithout being fully aware, in the ordinary course of life, that he orshe is undertaking an obligation to do his or her part byparticipating in a cooperative practice (dagger 1997, pp. 7378;besson 2005, pp. 48789). like michael hardimon and otherproponents of the associative theory of political obligation (see4.4, below), in other words, those who take this positionbelieve that there is no straightforward dichotomy between what isfully voluntary and what is altogether involuntary. in the middleground, they hold, there is room for the voluntary but notdeliberate or completely conscious acceptance of obligations.others respond to simmons' criticism by denying that fair-playobligations must be incurred voluntarily (arneson 1982; klosko 2004,3957). what matters is not that one accepts the benefits of thepractice, according to klosko's influential account, but that threeconditions are met: goods supplied must be (i) worth therecipients' effort in providing them; (ii) presumptivelybeneficial; and (iii) have benefits and burdens that are fairlydistributed (2004, p. 39). if, in sum, a state qualifies as acooperative enterprise, and if it provides its members with goods thatare presumptively beneficial or indispensable forsatisfactory lives (klosko 2005, p. 6) then its membershave an obligation grounded in fairness to obey its laws.whether these responses have swayed philosophical opinion in thedirection of fairplay theory is difficult to say, but theyclearly have not settled the debate in its favor. simmons, for one,continues to hold that modern political societies are too large andimpersonal to count as cooperative enterprises (2001, pp. 3842). healso contends that klosko's theory is not reallya fairness theory at all, but a disguisednatural duty theory, resting on an unstated moral duty to help supplyessential goods locally (2005, p. 190, emphasis inoriginal; also 2007, pp. 2223). others complain that fair-playtheory is not suitably sensitive to the possible alternatives theremay have been to the cooperative practices that have emerged. we mayadmit, on this view, that people receive benefits from a cooperativepractice, and even net benefits, but we should also notice that theymight have benefited more from the establishment of a differentpractice. to say, in these circumstances, that those who are engagedin a cooperative practice have an obligation to do their part is toaccept the principle of fairness as a powerfully conservativeprinciple (normore 2010, p. 231). in the political context,according to another critic, the proper comparison is between a stateof affairs in which benefits follow from other people's obeying thelaws in the sense of mere compliance, on the one hand, and a situationin which benefits follow from others' obeying specificallybecause the law says to do it (durning 2003,p. 255). if the benefits are the same in both cases, then there is noreason to think that true cooperation, rather than mere compliance, isproducing the benefits, and hence no reason to think that those whoreceive the benefits have a fair-play obligation to obey the laws.arguments such as these seem more likely to prolong than to settle thedebate over the principle of fair play. for conservatives, in fact,the claim that fair play is a powerfully conservativeprinciple is hardly a reason to reject the principle. othersmay note that having a fairplay obligation to the members of anongoing enterprise does not bar anyone from trying to transform thatenterprise, perhaps even by means of civil disobedience. as for theargument that compliance rather than cooperation is all that isnecessary to provide the benefits ordinarily associated with politicalsocieties, it seems likely to do no more than renew controversiesabout the nature of such societies and the viability of philosophicalanarchism. the question, in other words, is whether we can expect apolity to survive if its members regard one another notas cooperators in a common enterprise but exclusively as purchasers ofgovernmental services who comply with the law under the threat ofcoercion. for these reasons, fair-play theory is likely to remain alive but much disputed option for those who believe in politicalobligation.4.4 membership or associationaccording to proponents of a theory that has emerged in the lastthirty years or so, political obligation is best understood as anassociative obligation grounded in membership. if we aremembers of a group, they argue, then we are under anobligation, ceteris paribus, to comply with the norms thatgovern it. nor does this obligation follow from our consenting tobecome members, for it holds even in the case of groups orassociations, such as families and polities, that people typically donot consent to join. voluntary or not, membership entailsobligation. anyone who acknowledges membership in a particular politymust therefore acknowledge that he or she has a general obligation toobey its laws.at the core of the associative approach is the idea that politicalobligation is a form of non-voluntary obligation on a par withfamilial obligations. in ronald dworkin's words, politicalassociation, like family and friendship and other forms of associationmore local and intimate, is in itself pregnant of obligation(1986, p. 206). the same idea, with an explicit analogy betweenfamily and polity, is at work in john horton's account of politicalobligation:my claim is that a polity is, like the family, a relationship intowhich we are mostly born: and that the obligations which areconstitutive of the relationship do not stand in need of moraljustification in terms of a set of basic moral principles or somecomprehensive moral theory. furthermore, both the family and thepolitical community figure prominently in our sense of who we are: ourself-identity and our understanding of our place in the world (1992,pp. 15051).as members of families and political communities, on this view, we aresubject to what michael hardimon calls noncontractual roleobligations that is, obligations that simply flow fromroles into which we are born (1994, p. 347).the associative account of political obligation has at least threeattractive features. the first is the refusal of its proponents totreat voluntary and involuntary as twoparts of a dichotomy. it is true, they say, that most people do notvoluntarily undertake to become members of a polity, but that hardlymeans that membership has been forced or imposed on them. there is amiddle ground, and it is fertile soil for a theory of politicalobligation, just as it is for those who believe that being a member ofa family entails obligations that we have neither chosen, on the onehand, nor incurred against our will, on the other. a second attractionof the associative account is that it squares with a common intuition,as a great many people apparently do think of themselves as members ofpolitical societies who have an obligation to obey their polities'laws. this intuition, moreover, points to the third attractivefeature, which is the way in which the obligation to obey the lawsgrows out of the sense of identity that members of a politycommonly share. if this is my polity, and i find myselfthinking of its concerns as something that we members share,and its government as our government, then it will be easy tothink also that i have an obligation to obey its laws. for yael tamir,in fact, the true essence of associative obligations isthat they are not grounded on consent, reciprocity, orgratitude, but rather on a feeling of belonging orconnectedness (tamir, p, 137; see also scheffler 2001, esp. p. 64).like the other theories of political obligation, however, themembership account has met with considerable criticism, with threemain objections being raised (simmons 1996; wellman 1997; dagger2000). first, the critics maintain that the analogy between thepolity and the family is neither persuasive nor attractive. it isunpersuasive because the members of the modern polity lack the closeand intimate relationships with one another that family memberstypically share; and it is unattractive because it raises thepossibility that the paternalism appropriate within the family may beextended to the polity. second, the critics object that theassociative account conflates the sense of obligation withobligation itself. as wolff and other philosophical anarchists haveargued, the fact that many people feel a sense of identity with andobligation to their countries does not mean that they really have suchan obligation; nor need one be a philosophical anarchist to share thisconclusion. finally, there is the problem of what may be called groupcharacter. all groups have members, including groups that are notdecent, fair, or morally praiseworthy; but if membership is sufficientto generate an obligation to obey, then the members of unjust andexploitative groups will have an obligation to obey the rules. in thecase of the polity, this leads to the unpalatable andcounter-intuitive conclusion that the routinely exploited andoppressed members of an unjust polity are under anobligation to obey its laws.whether the proponents of the associative theory can overcome theseobjections remains, not surprisingly, a matter of debate. in somecases the proponents attempt to meet the critics head on, as hortondoes in the second edition of his political obligation(2010). there horton develops a two-pronged account of politicalobligation according to which the polity in question must supply thegeneric good of order and security and its members mustidentify with it and acknowledge its political authority (2010,p. 177, p. 184). in other cases, proponents attempt to bolster theassociative theory by incorporating elements of other theories, as inmassimo renzo's quasi-voluntarist reformulation of theassociative model, with its claim that we voluntarily occupyour roles even in families and polities as long as we couldhave stepped out of them if we had wanted (2012, p. 109,p. 120). to others, however, appeals to membership may be valuableas conceptual explorations of the hermeneutics or thephenomenology of political association, but they willnot generate political obligations unless the communities theydescribe can be legitimated in accordance with one or more of thestandard repertory of arguments (knowles 2010,p. 190).4.5 natural dutythe final contenders in the political obligation debates are naturalduty accounts. in this context, natural duties are understood to beones people have simply in virtue of their status as moral agents;they need do nothing to acquire them, nor does their bearing suchduties depend on their occupying some role in a socially salientrelationship. natural duties are also universal in scope; they areowed to all members of a class defined in terms of possession of somefeature, such as sentience or rationality. john rawls first broachedsuch an argument for political obligation when he asserted in atheory of justice that everyone is subject to a natural duty ofjustice that requires us to support and to comply with justinstitutions that exist and apply to us (1999 [1971],p. 99). more recently, jeremy waldron (1993, 1999), thomas christiano(2008), christopher heath wellman (2005), anna stilz (2009), and,arguably, david estlund (2008; see 4.1, above) have refined andexpanded upon rawls's somewhat vague contention, some of them in waysreminiscent of or even explicitly modeled on kant's defense ofpolitical obligation (see 1.5, above).contemporary natural duty theorists differ over the natural duty thatprovides the basis for political obligation. christiano grounds hisaccount in a fundamental principle of justice requiring the equaladvancement of people's interests, wellman in a samaritan duty of easyrescue, and stilz in a kantian duty of respect for others'sfreedom-as-independence, understood as a secure sphere ofself-determination defined by a person's rights. these theoristsagree, however, that moral agents can discharge their natural duty toothers only through submission to the authority of a common legalorder. this is so for several reasons: the demands of justice aresometimes underdetermined; its achievement requires the resolution ofcoordination problems; and most important, people reasonably disagreeover the demands of justice. christiano traces this disagreement towhat he calls the facts of judgment: diversity in people's naturaltalents and cultural surroundings, cognitive biases in theirinterpretation of people's interests and the value assigned to theirown interests relative to the value assigned to the interests ofothers, and fallibility in both moral and non-moral judgment. inlight of these facts, even those who make a good faith effort todiscern what justice requires of them in their interaction with otherswill fail to reach a consensus. agents who act on their own, private,judgment of justice will be perceived by others to be acting unjustly.if some are able to unilaterally impose their conception of justice onothers, the latter will not enjoy freedom-as-independence (stilz2009), or will suffer the violation of their fundamental interests inbeing at home in the world, in correcting for others' cognitivebiases, and in being treated by one's fellows as a person with equalmoral standing (christiano). only submission to a common legal ordercan provide a solution to this problem of domination and conflict,argue the natural duty proponents of political obligation.there is no way other than general compliance with a singleauthoritative set of rules to secure peace and protect basic moralrights (wellman 2005, p. 45); law settle[s] forpractical purposes what justice consists in by promulgating publicrules for the guidance of individual behavior (christiano,p. 53); or in stilz's kantian terms, law replaces the unilateralimposition of obligations on others with the omnilateral imposition ofobligations on all.not just any legal order will do, though. rather, many natural dutytheorists of political obligation argue either that the law mustcrafted according to democratic procedures or that it must not violatecertain individual rights, or both, if those it addresses are to havea duty to obey it. christiano, for instance, argues that against abackground constituted by diversity, cognitive bias, and fallibility,agents can be sure that their fundamental interest in judgment willnot be unjustifiably set back only if political power is exercisedwithin institutions that publicly realize equality, i.e., democraticones. likewise, waldron defends the authority of a majority-ruledecision procedure on the basis of its commitment to equality a determination that when we, who need to settle on a singlecourse of action, disagree about what to do, there is no reasonablebasis for us in designing our decision-procedures to accord greaterweight to one side than to the other in the disagreement(waldron 1999, p. 117; see also lefkowitz 2005a). even if a persondoes not believe that the particular scheme of distributive justicerealized in the law treats her justly, she can recognize that theprocess whereby that scheme was created, and can be modified oreliminated, does treat her as an equal. stilz argues that lawomnilaterally imposes obligations on all only if it expresses ageneral will. it does the latter if and only if it first,defines rights (protected interests) that apply equally to all;second, it defines these rights via a procedure that considerseveryone's interests equally; and third, everyone who is coerced toobey the law has a voice in the procedure (stilz 2009, p. 78).the latter two conditions, she maintains, can only be met by ademocratic procedure.whatever its details, many natural duty theorists also argue that theconception of the person that grounds their accounts of politicalobligation also limits the scope of legitimate law. reasonabledisagreement over freedom-as-independence does not extend to torture,for example, and at some perhaps indeterminate point the denial offreedom of conscience clearly conflicts with a person's fundamentalinterests in correcting for cognitive bias and being at home in theworld. most natural duty theorists conclude that subjects of a legalorder that recognizes no rights on the part of some or all of itssubjects against such treatment lacks legitimate authority, even if itis democratic.recall that natural duty accounts of political obligation begin withduties that all moral agents owe to all other moral persons as such.simmons argues that this commitment renders natural duty accountsunable to justify the particularity of political obligations; that is,the fact that people have political obligations in virtue of theircitizenship or residence in particular states, and that they owe thoseobligations to that particular state (or to their fellow citizens)(simmons 1979, pp. 3135; 2005, pp. 16679). even if we have anatural duty to support and comply with justinstitutions, as rawls claims, why must we discharge that dutyby supporting and complying with the just institutions that comprisethe state in which we are citizens or residents? true, those are theinstitutions that apply to us, in the sense that theyclaim jurisdiction over us. but why think that this social fact hasany moral import, particularly if we think the political institutionsof other states more worthy of our support because they better promotejustice, or are in greater need of support?some natural duty theorists point to the intensity and frequency ofinteraction among those who live in close proximity to one another asa justification for the duty to obey the laws of the particularjurisdiction in which one resides (waldron 1993, 1996). othersemphasize that a person who free-rides on his fellow citizens' supportfor and compliance with the law to act on his own judgment of how hecan best discharge his natural duty of justice unfairly takesadvantage of them. absent their good-faith sacrifice of the libertyto act on their private judgments regarding what justice requires, thefree-rider would likely be unable to act as he does (wellman 2005,pp. 4445). finally, some natural duty theorists argue that simmonsmisconstrues the natural duty of justice. justice is not an outcomeor state of affairs that agents have a duty to promote via whatevermeans they judge to be most effective or efficient, be it thepolitical institutions of their state or those of another. rather,justice characterizes a particular manner of interacting with others,such as with respect for their freedom-as-independence or theirfundamental interests, including but not limited to their interests injudgment. at least for a citizen of a liberal democratic state, thelatter construal of justice entails that she can only treat her fellowcitizens justly if she guides her conduct according to its law.simmons has recently rebutted this second line of argument (simmons2013; but cf. stilz 2013). the argument entails, he claims, thatcitizens of one liberal-democratic state who are forcibly subjected tothe rule of another liberal-democratic state immediately acquirepolitical obligations to the second state as long as they are accordedfull citizenship rights. simmons treats this implication asa reductio ad absurdum of the democratic kantianjustification for political obligation, a demonstration that it cannotproperly account for the particularity of such obligations. in part,this latest rejoinder by simmons evidences and gives further impetusto a shift in the debate over political obligation from the questionof what gives states a right to rule particular people, to whichcorrelates their duty to obey the law, to the question of what givesstates a right to rule over a particular territory. but it alsopoints to the need for natural duty theorists to elaborate upon theirso far brief discussions of the contribution that a legitimateinternational legal order makes to the legitimacy of domestic legalorders.5. conclusion: a plurality of principles?the five theories of political obligation sketched above do notexhaust the possibilities dorota mokrosinska, for instance,has recently advanced a civil justice theory in her rethinkingpolitical obligation but they seem to represent the mainlines of argument. indeed, even mokrosinska acknowledges that herargument from civil justice combines elements of both naturalduty accounts and associative theories (2012, p. 174). in fact,the search for a hybrid theory is something a number of philosophershave undertaken, either implicitly or explicitly, in recentyears. gilbert (2006) and steinberger (2004), for example, seem tohave developed hybrid theories without ever advertising them assuch. gilbert's theory fuses the consent and associative approachesthrough her reliance on joint commitments to a pluralsubject, or group. for his part, steinberger combines the consentand natural-duty approaches, arguing that any generalizedattempt to divorce obligations from natural duties, to findjustifications for the former that are entirely independent of thelatter, is doomed to fail (2004, p. 211). wellmanevidently agrees with this point, but he explicitly acknowledges thehybrid nature of his theory, which combines an appeal to the naturalduty of samaritanism with reliance on the argument from fair play(2005, esp. chap. 2).others, notably klosko (2005), jonathan wolff (1995, 2000), and dudleyknowles (2010), have explicitly called for a pluralistic ormultiple-principle approach to political obligation. there is nosingle answer to the problem of political obligation, as they see it,because the problem has more than one aspect. not everymember of a polity will stand in the same relation toits laws, for instance, which means that it is a mistake to think thateveryone must have the same general obligation to obey. nor is everyobligation of equal force. some are weak, such as the notoriousobligation to stop at a traffic signal when no one else is around, andothers are quite strong. klosko thus thinks it necessary to rely onthe principle of fairness to supply the core of a justification, butto supplement it with appeals to natural duty and the common good(2006, chap. 5).as yet there has been little reaction to these attempts to fuseapproaches and draw on multiple principles in the attempt to provide asatisfactory theory of political obligation (but see edmundson 2004,pp. 25052). those who doubt that such a theory can be constructed,however, are likely to say that combining principles, whether inhybrid or pluralist fashion, will not help, for combining a set ofprinciples that are unsatisfactory individually will hardly produce astrong and satisfying theory (simmons 2007, n. 17). on the other hand,those who believe that political obligation is fundamentally a problemof showing that those who live in a polity governed by the rule of lawdo indeed have a general obligation to obey its laws, ratherthan a bundle of obligations to obey its laws severally, in piecemealfashion (e.g., mapel 2005), are likely to see no need for a pluralityof principles. whether a plurality of principles is necessary or evendesirable, in sum, remains one of many open questions with regard tothe vexing problem of political obligation.bibliography arneson, richard, 1982. the principle of fairness andfree-rider problems, ethics, 92: 616-33.bell, nora k., 1978. nozick and the principle offairness, social theory
