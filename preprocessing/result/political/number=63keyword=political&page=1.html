tenure track faculty members at colleges and universities. professors can influence current government policies by writing essays in political journals, by engaging politicians in debates, and by researching the effects of proposed laws. faculty members also affect future political movements by encouraging students to explore controversial ideas.during their degree programs, political science

understanding the evolution of our current form of democracy, political science majors can integrate the best practices of past millennia into new ideas and proposals.political science majors review the formal laws and traditions of ruling bodies, as well as the informal but powerful ways that people influence each other. students learn to appreciate the back room lobbying and the other subtle ways that real power brokers have shifted world culture over the years. political science majors that study the hidden psychological elements of politics can become valuable advisors on their way to wielding true power and authority of their own.what do political science majors do?political science majors examine world events from a variety of perspectives. because many voters often make decisions in the heat of the moment, students learn to research the context in which governments have thrived or failed in their missions to advance particular social agendas.students often concentrate on a specific area of politics, like international relations or local government. very few politicians understand all the issues facing their constituents. therefore, they rely on teams of

them to achieve expert status in their fields.career education in political sciencemany colleges and universities encourage students of all ages to participate in their political science departments.

promotions or career moves.an associate degree in political science can expose a student to some of the career opportunities available in public service. however, competition for paid opportunities is
