 they revisit political history with ideas and tools from political science.  finally, political scientists draw lessons from their inquiries for good public policy, for good government, and for good citizenship – and for better political science, including better methods.the faculty members of the swarthmore political science department reflect, in their intellectual and research interests, the exceptional pluralism of political science and seek to convey the discipline’s richness and variety in their courses, in the speakers we bring to campus, and in discussions with students after class or during office hours. we arrange course offerings by the traditional subdivisions of the discipline as it is practiced in the united states: american politics, comparative politics, international relations, and political theory. our offerings are particularly strong in the study of china, constitutional law, the study of congress, environmental policy and politics, faith-based social policy, the presidency, the study of american parties and elections, u.s. civil rights, international trade and political economy, the cognitive and perceptual dimensions of international politics, latin american politics, theories of prophetic political vision, ancient and modern political theory, democratic theory and civic engagement, iranian politics, and american political development. students currently have access to interdisciplinary and innovative pedagogies in gis training, for understanding local democracy in and around swarthmore and poverty in chester, pa, and for understanding the nature of mass incarceration in the united states. we also offer many opportunities to explore linkages between the theory and practice of politics. some courses are earmarked for their emphasis on community-based learning.  political science academic programcoursesfaculty staffevents resources library resources news listen: criminal defense attorney david rudovsky on policing and racial justice rudovsky, a senior fellow at the university of pennsylvania law school, recently presented the 2014 constitution day lecture. more you have disabled javascript or you have an old version of adobe's flash player. download the latest version of flash player. audio: [48 min 10 sec] | download interdisciplinary study examines federal reserve thinking prior to 2008 financial crisis listen: political scientist dominic tierney on a world on fire: barack obama and the crisis of global order second tuesday social science cafe lecture series kicks off political scientist brendan nyhan 00 tackles false beliefs in latest study events calendar feedevents are currently being scheduled and will be posted shortly.type_31110 contact us department of political scienceswarthmore college 500 college avenue swarthmore, pa 19081-1397phone: 610-328-8127fax: 610-328-8442send an email to politicalscience popular destinations: a-z indexacademic calendarapply to swarthmorebookstorecampus calendar career servicesemploymentlang center for civic social responsibilitymake a giftscott arboretum alumnicampus communityparentsvisitors join us: search: search search submit site feedback swarthmore college, 500 college avenue, swarthmore, pa 19081 phone: 610-328-8000 email: webeditor@swarthmore.edu 2014 swarthmore college. all rights reserved. see privacy policy.
