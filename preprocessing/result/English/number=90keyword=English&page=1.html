they are usually not new articles.this makes simple english articles a good way to understand difficult articles from the ordinary english wikipedia. if someone cannot understand an idea in complex english, they can read the simple english article. for this reason, people writing simple english articles should put in "interwiki links" to and from the other wikipedias. also, it is good to always look at all versions in all languages, to get new ideas."wikipedia:what wikipedia is not" has a good list of things which we are not doing. these things are a little different from the things the ordinary english wikipedia does not do. for example, in the simple english version it is more important to explain slang, idiom, and jargon. the simple english wikipedia also has some articles that are also in the wiktionary.anyone can write in the simple english wikipedia. simple english writers are very mixed, more so than at english wikipedia, or at other wikipedias. it is important to respect the different types of people who are writing articles in the simple english wikipedia, and to be friendly with people who have trouble speaking english. remember that wikipedia is a service which many communities use.if you want to write articles for the simple english wikipedia, read wikipedia:how to write simple english articles. see wikipedia for a simple english introduction to the project in all languages, and wikipedia:useful for a list of pages that can help you more. you can ask questions at wikipedia:simple talk.simple english[change | change source]main page: basic englishsimple english is similar to english, but it only uses basic words.we suggest that articles should use only the 1,000 most common and basic words in english. they should also use only simple grammar and shorter sentences. writers can also use a special system, for example, basic english. of course, people can write original articles; these could be put in both this and the main wikipedia (with a normal level of english). usually, only about 2,000 words are enough to write a normal article.since some articles need more than 2,000 different words, some complex articles use more words. but even very basic concepts (zero, one, two) are too difficult to explain with a small number of words.for detailed writing about science, politics, or religion, articles sometimes need more words, but the english must be simple. sometimes, an article uses more than 2,000 words, or, at most, 3,000, but it explains all the difficult words. articles need some complex words because of the article names in the ordinary english wikipedia, and to use normal words would make the article too simple. articles on scientific topics (like earth) might need complex words.there are no rules about vocabulary, tense or suffixes. some articles use only basic english (850 words), but this wiki has no strong rules about which words can be used, as e prime does. if a word is not simple or not used often here, it should be explained on a new page.the proposals to close the simple english wikipedia[change | change source]two times there have been proposals to close simple english wikipedia. see meta:proposals for closing projects/closure of simple english wikipedia (october 2007) and meta:proposals for closing projects/closure of simple english wikipedia (2) (october 2008).related pages[change | change source]plain english campaignreadability testwikipedia:how to write simple english articleswikipedia:statisticsa firefox plugin to search this wikipedia - made by sonia. retrieved from category: wikipedia navigation menu personal tools create accountlog in namespaces project page talk variants views read change change source view history more search getting around main page simple start simple talk new changes show any page help give to wikipedia print/export make a book download as pdf page for printing tools what links here related changes upload file special pages permanent link page information wikidata item in other languages english español 日本語 türkçe change links this page was last changed on 24 september 2014, at 03:41. text is available under the creative commons attribution/share-alike license and the gfdl;
