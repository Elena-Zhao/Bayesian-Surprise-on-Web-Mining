if the plural of tooth is teeth, why isn’t the plural of booth beeth? one goose, 2 geese. so, one moose, 2 meese? one index, two indices? is cheese the plural of choose? if teachers taught, why didn’t preachers praught? if a vegetarian eats vegetables, what does a humanitarian eat? in what language do people recite at a play and play at a recital? ship by truck and send cargo by ship? have noses that run and feet that smell? park on driveways and drive on parkways? how can a slim chance and a fat chance be the same, while a wise man and a wise guy are opposites? how can the weather be hot as hell one day an cold as hell another? when a house burns up, it burns down. you fill in a form by filling it out and an alarm clock goes off by going on. when the stars are out, they are visible, but when the lights are out, they are invisible. and why, when i wind up my watch, i start it, but when i wind up this essay, i end it? now i know why i flunked my english. it’s not my fault; the silly language doesn’t quite know whether it’s coming or going. -richard lederer.by lorelilimarch 28, 2005760296merch5.englishincredibly powerful and brutal race of people. renowned worldwide for the ability to fight, hence why they are assiciated with lions, dragons, bulldogs etc, while the rose represents beauty.oh my its the english soccer hooligans, run!by willapril 02, 20061268867merch6.englishto paraphrase from pulp fiction:sammy l. jackson: hey brad, where you from?brad:what?slj: what?
