useful funny cool qype user silver… bracknell 5 friends 60 reviews share review 8/10/2008 very good italian food.modern cooking and mostly italian wines,book in advance.£15.95 for two courses steve c. london 0 friends 61 reviews share review compliment send message follow steve c. stop following steve c. 28/8/2011 first to review a great little italian and to my mind the best food to be had in wokingham by a wide margin.so where to start. the restaurant is in a period converted house, which once belonged to the family who owned number 6 (where the restaurant is situated) and the imposing building at the end of rose street (i remember visiting the daughter in a past life here but well move on) its intimate warm and has a great feel at the front whilst there is a less intimate but larger area at the back principally used for groups. the italian staff offer a genuine warm welcome and repeat visits make you feel part of the family! the menu is well balanced with a broad selection of italian standards. the crab and cod ravioli with the saffron sauce is superb whilst the crab salad is a fresh triumph of a dish. mains are equally accomplished, the fillet steak with fois gras delivers big bold flavours and turbot is a another favourite of mine. the wine list which is exclusively italian, offers a wonderful selection, the russiz pinot on my last visit was outstanding. service is performed with aplomb, and it is performed, this place has a heart beat a rhythm and there is a pride taken in executing every task. deserts are equally polished the tiramisu is a rich sticky delight and the home made chocolate cake is to die for. all in all the food service and atmosphere are all top drawer. so to the trifling, grubby part, the bill. . its not cheap, its squarely in the top end of the range, but then so it should be, so it deserves to be. youll leave lighter of cash but richer in spirit and bloody well fed! was this review ? useful 1 funny cool qype user bus… wokingham 4 friends 77 reviews share review 21/2/2009 the first time i was taken by a friend who put it on expenses. the food was utterly fantastic - we went to town i had a little trouble walking home. a very memorable evening (or the bits i managed to remember were!) returned with same friend again the food was very good but because my expectations were very high, the meal was merely first-rate.the 3rd visit was to celebrate my girlfriends birthday where we got a little more amourous than the italian staff felt comfortable with! again each course was great, the wine good the atmosphere equally fine. my girlfriend got suitably fed watered before we staggered off to the broad street tavern for a nightcap - £125 worse off - you gets what you pay for! the best most expsensive out of the many italian restaurants in wokingham. went back in 2008 for a set meal for four of us one saturday lunchtime - again great food but a little more wouldnt have goon amiss! page 1 of 1 2 other reviews that are not currently recommended business info summary edit business info work here?
