answer: development describes the growth of humans throughout the lifespan, from conception to death. the scientific study of human development seeks to understand and explain how and why people change throughout life. this includes all aspects of human growth, including physical, emotional, intellectual, social, perceptual, and personality development. the scientific study of development is important not only to psychology, but also to sociology, education, and health care. development does not just involve the biological and physical aspects of growth, but also the cognitive and social aspects associated with development throughout life. the study of human development is important in a number of subjects, including biology, anthropology, sociology, education, history, and psychology. most important, however, are the practical applications of studying human development. by better understanding how and why people change and grow, we can then apply this knowledge to helping people live up to their full potential.next: issues in developmental psychology related articlesan overview of early childhood development3 important theories of developmentlesson seven: development5 reasons you should study human developmenterikson's psychosocial stages summary chart our expert recommends issues in developmental psychology child development theories development research methods psychology essentials learn the basics of psychology psychology glossary: p index left-brain vs. right-brain: the surprising truth cognitive psychology what can you do with a bachelor's degree in psychology?
