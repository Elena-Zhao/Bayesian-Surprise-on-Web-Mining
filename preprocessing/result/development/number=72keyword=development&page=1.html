(in this context, 'congruency' means behaving and feeling naturally and comfortably - ie, true to oneself.) modern personal development applications the integrated personal development approach is highly beneficial for most people. it is however particularly effective for people who have experienced little or no benefit from conventional training, especially where progress is blocked by issues raised in the training process. integrated personal development is also particularly helpful where one-to-one coaching or mentoring has had limited benefit, or has prompted surprising reactions. equally, those who want to develop themselves in some way, but cannot identify a particular direction, will also benefit from this sort of modern integrated personal development. personal development essentials modern personal development differs from conventional training methods, most importantly: by settling the past by reducing the effort required to live in the present by formulating a compelling future these fundamentals are rarely found in traditional skills training or coaching. the principles underpin the process of effective personal development. modern personal development - an alternative to traditional training methods modern personal development tends to achieve results because: it creates balance in the system (the person as a whole) it is realistic (and is perceived by the person as being achievable and relevant) it reduces stress, and it increases personal control these factors are not commonly present in traditional skills training or one-to-one coaching, and as such provide a useful alternative if traditional methods have not been effective. personal development outcomes many situations benefit from the improvements arising from effective personal development, for example: within a corporate environment - producing better organizational performance and effectiveness to improve self-awareness to improve personal communication with others to improve personal relationships with others reducing and resolving conflict and stress traditional training can of course produce good results in these areas, however, some people require more focus on personal issues, which can be difficult for some types of traditional training to address. modern personal development - component theory examples human development human development includes the 'nature and nurture' elements that determine who we are and how we behave. human development is a lifelong process beginning with 'nature'. our 'nature' elements are everything we bring into this world: from our genetic make-up, our conception, up until our birth. after we are born, the 'nurture' process begins; namely every influence we encounter that affects us: our environmental influences and behavioural conditioning by others. we are each also subject to a slow continuous forming process; a sequence of stages through which we each pass in the same order, over a number of years. throughout these stages other developments occur: brain development; motor development; cognitive development; social development and development of self concept and basic trust. in addition, and importantly, our emotional development. the influence of these human development factors on people, and their response to change, is considerable. humanistic theories humanistic theories focus on our inner capacity for growth and self-fulfillment; with the emphasis on human potential. the early theorists referred to humans as being 'set up' or 'pre-programmed' for growth and fulfillment, unless thwarted by an environment that restricts growth. from a humanistic perspective, a positive self-concept is the key to personal happiness and success in life. moreover, acceptance and empathy help us to nurture positive feelings about ourselves, and that consequently we develop the capacity to extend and apply positive feelings to others. overall, a humanistic perspective purports that people are basically good, and capable of self improvement. (see also mcgregor's xy theory, which includes aspects of humanistic thinking, and usefully positions them in the context of corporate organizations, management, motivational development, etc.) neuro-linguistic programming neuro-linguistic programming is a model of human experience and communication. it has also been referred to as a study of subjective experience and human excellence. importance is placed on rapport: mutual trust and responsiveness. rapport can be applied to your relationship with yourself and your relationship with others. nlp states that the greater the mental, physical and emotional rapport with yourself, the greater your health, well-being and inner peace. as a result, the greater your ability to relate to and influence others. other pivotal aspects are: knowing what you want - setting your goal or outcome using your senses - being aware of what is happening to you helps you regain the curiosity and acuity you had as a child - this increases behavioural flexibility, which improves your chances of success (see the first law of cybernetics). see also the detailed free introductory guide to neuro-linguistic programming. energy psychology energy psychology is the collective term for a range of approaches focusing on the interconnectedness of mind and body. a principle of energy psychology is that psychological and physical problems can be treated through the body's meridian system and other bodily systems. some of the approaches have their roots in traditional chinese medicine energy healing, such as acupuncture. from an energy psychology perspective; if the energy or meridian system balance is upset and left unchecked, there will be a physical manifestation. if there is a disturbance in the system, there will be impairment in thinking, and physical health. clear the disturbance, and the body can do what it is meant to do - repair and/or heal itself, creating harmony and balance. by carefully integrating and applying the behavioural models explained above, pam weight has developed a truly progressive and effective system of personal development. the approach is in tune with the needs of people living and working in the modern age, and provides a useful alternative to traditional training, coaching and mentoring practices. effective personal development must value the person's individual journey; acknowledge the person's learning from experiences; offer the opportunity for the person to update their system; and free the individual to consider their current capabilities and how and where to apply them. truly effective personal development must be tailored for the individual, and be flexible and realistic, producing real and sustainable results, the basis of which must always be improved balance, less stress and more control. pam weight pam weight is a psychotherapist with special interest in health and wellness, based in nuneaton, warwickshire. the contribution of this article by pam weight is gratefully acknowledged. pam weight's website, including contact information and services details, is at: search businessballs website e.g. swot analysis, change management, cv template, team building... browse categories business/selling sales, marketing, strategy, business management glossaries/terminology glossaries, dictionaries, acronyms, lists of terms human resources recruitment and selection, training, job interviews teambuilding/games activities, games, icebreakers, quizzes, puzzles lifestyle/environment climate change, sleeping aids, reiki amusement/stress relief funny and inspirational stories, quotes, humour personal development personal development, self-discovery, self-help, life balance leadership/management delegation, motivation, change management writing/communicating cv templates, reference letters, resignation letters diagrams and tools free templates, samples, resources, tests and quizzes the use this material is free provided copyright (see below) is acknowledged and reference or link is made to the website. this material may not be sold, or published in any form. disclaimer: reliance on information, material, advice, or other linked or recommended resources, received from alan chapman, shall be at your sole risk, and alan chapman assumes no responsibility for any errors, omissions, or damages arising. users of this website are encouraged to confirm information received with other sources, and to seek local qualified advice if embarking on any actions that could carry personal or organisational liabilities. managing people and relationships are sensitive activities; the free material and advice available via this website do not provide all necessary safeguards and checks. please retain this notice on all copies. pam weight original concept, alan chapman edit and contextual material 2004-2011
