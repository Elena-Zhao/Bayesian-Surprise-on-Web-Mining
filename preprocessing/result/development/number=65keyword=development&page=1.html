(*hint:* you will have to hold off on picking out the pink or blue until at least the second trimester when the gender will be visible via ultrasound.) • implantation - some spotting (also known as implantation bleeding) may occur about 10 - 14 days after conception. you may believe you are starting your period but generally this bleeding is extremely light and lasts only a day or so. • neural tube forms at 1-4 weeks of your pregnancy - it will develop into the nervous system (brain, spinal cord, hair, and skin). already your baby has the foundation for thought, senses, feeling, and more! • at 1-4 weeks pregnant, heart and primitive circulatory system rapidly form - while still in its beginning stages, this is the very life support system that will carry your child throughout his or her life. copyright © pregnancy.org.images:3d ultrasound images reprinted with permission from eco-3d and sonoportal. embryoscopy and fetoscopy photos appearing on this web site are reproduced under "fair use" terms for the purpose of public education. recent forum postsre: waiting to oi'm hoping for any baby, i don't care when. af arrived yesterday for mre: ultra sound 8 weeks 5 daysthank you!!!!will keep you posted.you on facebook?pm me details if re: ultra sound 8 weeks 5 dayscrossing my fingers for you! i am praying this one is your sticky beanmore latest pollhow old were you when you had your first child?under 1811%19 - 2226%23 - 2937%30 - 3521%36 - 403%41 - 450%46 +3%total votes: 38 register / log in now to vote.older pollsnewsletterstay informed on our latest news, by parents for parents™!e-mail * about uscontact usprivacy policysitemapterms conditions all contents herein this site including the site name are under copyright protection. © 2001-2014 pregnancy.org.   all rights reserved.    by parents, for parents is a trademark of pregnancy.org
