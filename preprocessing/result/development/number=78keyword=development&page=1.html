(or george oscar bluth ii, pronounced jobe). after george sr. is sent to prison, the unbearable family members turn to michael to head the corporation and handle their funds. through it all, michael has a son, george michael, a timid and rather confounded young man who idolizes his daddy, has a mild infatuation with his only cousin, maeby (lindsay's daughter), and is in charge of the semi-popular bluth frozen banana stand at newport beach's balboa island. not to mention the unexplainable carl weathers guest appearances, ron howard's uncredited narration, and brother-in-law tobias' acting attempts, this program deserves its merit. 94 of 160 people found this review helpful. was this review helpful to you? yes no review this title | see all 279 user reviews message boards recent posts s4 complaints ex-why-zee why should i watch this? charlie-bell133 buster's funniest moment audrey_l pls give me reasons why i should continue watching this andrenmathers cinco de quatro bassgoilius what's in the foil? eosab-7 discuss arrested development (2003) on the imdb message boards getting started |contributor zone contribute to this page edit page add episode write review create a character page for: narrator ----------- more... create ? home | search | site index | in theaters | coming soon | top movies | top 250 | tv | news | message boards | press room register | advertising | contact us | jobs | imdbpro | box office mojo | withoutabox imdb mobile: iphone/ipad | android | mobile site | windows phone 7 | imdb social: facebook | twitter copyright 1990-2014 imdb.com, inc. conditions of use | privacy policy | interest-based ads an company. amazon affiliates amazon instant video watch movies online prime instant video unlimited streamingof movies & tv amazon germany buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon italy buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon france buy movies ondvd & blu-ray amazon india buy movie andtv show dvds dpreview digitalphotography audible downloadaudio books
