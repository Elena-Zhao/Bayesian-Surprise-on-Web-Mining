(2005) edited by uma kothari this edited collection assembles what are otherwise often scattered and implicit contributions to thinking on the history of development studies as a subject. the authors reflect on their own experiences in the sector and examine the evolution of both the roles of institutions and development discourse. in doing so, this book presents a more nuanced and contested evolution and serves to highlight the contributions made by thinking, which although part of its day, is seldom part of orthodox recollection. for anyone new to the subject this historical perspective provides an essential introduction to its origins, which constitutes the backdrop to fuller understanding of contemporary changes and trends in both the theory and practice of development. a radical

further info: how volunteering at unesco changes lives in international organisations such as unesco, interns are welcome to work alongside staff on development programmes and special projects. and, fortunately for the agency, many young people are willing to do just that, offering their time in exchange for experience. so, what drives this motivation, and what challenges and lessons are learned along the way?unpaid labour makes up a relatively sizeable part of the workforce at unesco's bangkok branch. at any one time, there are usually 15 to 30 young people volunteering for anything between a month and a whole year.apart from interns, there are other classified volunteers as well. mostly female, they come in all ages, though most average in their late 20s, with a wide range of experience, educational backgrounds and nationalities, mainly europe, north america and developed asian nations like japan, south korea and hong kong. unesco's director sheldon shaeffer hopes to see more interns from southeast asia, especially thailand.to be eligible, interns should be enrolled in university and be able to volunteer a maximum of six months. although they receive no stipend, unesco internships are well regarded by young people seeking international careers. the process for many begins at however, opportunities as great as this come at a price with many volunteers learning unexpected lessons.for starters, the work can be intense with volunteers investing both passion and energy to contribute to unesco's mission. just like paid staff, they find themselves working long hours in order to maximise success. the key motivational factor for volunteers is their sense of achievement and contribution to a great cause.when asked about the biggest challenges, financial concerns and disappointment rank highly. all agree that longer stays amount to a better, more satisfying experience, as it takes time to get to know a project well. but long stints as a volunteer don't come easy or cheap. apart from the cost of flying to thailand, expenses include accommodation, food, a laptop, visas and even transport to and from work-related events, such as meetings and conferences, even when outside of thailand. feeling unappreciated in the rush to get things done also affects motivation, though some volunteers feel more frustrated than others. we don't expect payment, but more appreciation would be nice, one volunteer said. being at the bottom of the hierarchy where credit for good work can be overlooked may result in diminishing enthusiasm, and enthusiasm is a volunteer's most essential attribute.read the full article: how volunteering at unesco changes lives corporate social opportunity â€“ taking ethical risks to market growing numbers of companies are seeing opportunities in meeting social and environmental needs, but business as a whole is not moving fast enough, say david grayson and adrian hodges global revolutions in technology, markets, demographics and values are giving companies a whole new set of issues that they have to manage urgently.these issues include the environment, human rights, diversity, health, work-life balance and the community. historically, these have been regarded as soft issues, but they have become hard for business: hard to ignore, hard to manage, and very hard for the businesses that get them wrong.we first marked this trend in our book everybodys business: managing risks and opportunities in todays global society, in 2001. three years later, in corporate social opportunity, we further developed our argument that, handled correctly, these issues need not just be about minimising risk, but could become a source of new marketplace insight and a stimulus to innovation. we always saw corporate social opportunity as being a corporate mindset, as well as developments in products and services. uk fruit smoothies maker innocent drinks, which has made its commitment to sustainability integral to
