locally, provincially, nationally, and globally. our goal is to learn from one another, regardless of nation, culture, income, academic discipline, profession or ideology. we hope to set a modest example of enduring global cooperation through maintaining an international dialogue and dismantling barriers to communication.benefits to authorswe also provide many author benefits, such as free pdfs, a liberal copyright policy, special discounts on elsevier publications and much more. please click here for more information on our author services.please see our guide for authors for information on article submission. if you require any further information or help, please visit our support pages: world development is a multi-disciplinary monthly journal of development studies. it seeks to explore ways of improving standards of living, and the human condition generally, by examining potential solutions... view full aims and scope editor-in-chief: arun agrawalview full editorial board guide for authorsauthor instructionsuseful linksview ‘guide for authors’ onlineread the ‘8 reasons why i accepted your article’ blogdownload the ‘understanding the publishing process’ pdfsubmit your paperenter your login details for world development below. if you do not already have an account you will need to register here.usernamepasswordi forgot my passwordregister new accounttrack your papercheck submitted papertrack accepted paperusernamepasswordi forgot my passwordonce your article has been accepted you will receive an email from author services. this email contains a link to check the status of your article.track your accepted paperorder journalview articles journal metricssource normalized impact per paper (snip): 2.098source normalized impact per paper (snip):2013: 2.098snip measures contextual citation impact by weighting citations based on the total number of citations in a subject field.scimago journal rank (sjr): 1.472scimago journal rank (sjr):2013: 1.472sjr is a prestige metric based on the idea that not all citations are the same. sjr uses a similar algorithm as the google page rank;
