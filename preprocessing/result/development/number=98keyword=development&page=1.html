2014this page: print all information e.g. expanded side notes, shows alternative links, use the print part of the globalissues.org web site attempts to introduce the issue of development and sustainable development. sustainable development is often an over-used word, but goes to the heart of tackling a number of inter-related global issues such as poverty, inequality, hunger and environmental degradation.in theory, development that is sustainable and not damaging to the planet is very possible. of course though, in reality there are a lot of politics and challenges involved as highlighted throughout this site.this section is woefully small to start off with, and hardly covers the issues in enough depth, though over time, i hope to add more articles to the ones below.13 articles on “sustainable development” and 6 related issues:sustainable development introductionlast updated wednesday, november 18, 2009. the idea of sustainable development grew from numerous environmental movements in earlier decades. summits such as the earth summit in rio, brazil, 1992, were major international meetings to bring sustainable development to the mainstream.however, the record on moving towards sustainability so far appears to have been quite poor. the concept of sustainability means many different things to different people, and a large part of humanity around the world still live without access to basic necessities.read “sustainable development introduction” to learn more.addressing biodiversity losslast updated wednesday, april 06, 2011. at the 1992 un conference on environment and development (the earth summit), the convention on biological diversity (cbd) was born. 192 countries, plus the eu, are now parties to that convention. in april 2002, the parties to the convention committed to significantly reduce the loss of biodiversity loss by 2010.perhaps predictably, that did not happen. despite numerous successful conservations measures supporting biodiversity, the 2010 biodiversity target has not been met at the global level. this page provides an overview on how the attempts to prevent biodiversity loss is progressing.read

ngos are non-profit organizations filling the gap where governments will not, or cannot function. in the past however, some ngos from the wealthy nations have received a bad reputation in some developing nations because of things like arrogance, imposition of their views, being a foreign policy arm or tool of the original country and so on. even in recent years some of these criticisms still hold. however, recently some new and old ngos alike, have started to become more participatory and grassroots-oriented to help empower the people they are trying to help, to help themselves. this is in general a positive turn. yet, the fact that there are so many ngos popping up everywhere perhaps points to failures of international systems of politics, economics, markets, and basic rights.read “non-governmental organizations on development issues” to learn more.foreign aid for development assistancelast updated sunday, september 28, 2014.in 1970, the world’s rich countries agreed to give 0.7% of their gross national income as official international development aid, annually.since that time, billions have certainly been given each year, but rarely have the rich nations actually met their promised target.for example, the us is often the largest donor in dollar terms, but ranks amongst the lowest in terms of meeting the stated 0.7% target.furthermore, aid has often come with a price of its own for the developing nations. common criticisms, for many years, of foreign aid, have included the following:aid is often wasted on conditions that the recipient must use overpriced goods and services from donor countriesmost aid does not actually go to the poorest who would need it the mostaid amounts are dwarfed by rich country protectionism that denies market access for poor country products while rich nations use aid as a lever to open poor country markets to their productslarge projects or massive grand strategies often fail to help the vulnerable; money can often be embezzled away.this article explores who has benefited most from this aid, the recipients or the donors.read “foreign aid for development assistance” to learn more.g8: too much power?posted

securitylast updated sunday, may 15, 2011. energy security is a growing concern for rich and emerging nations alike. the past drive for fossil fuel energy has led to wars, overthrow of democratically elected leaders, and puppet governments and dictatorships.leading nations admit we are addicted to oil, but investment into alternatives has been lacking, or little in comparison to fossil fuel investments.as the global financial crisis takes hold and awareness of climate change increases, more nations and companies are trying to invest in alternatives. but will the geopolitics remain the same?read “energy security” to learn more.brain drain of workers from poor to rich countriesposted friday, april 14, 2006.brain drain is a problem for many poor countries losing skilled workers to richer countries. in healthcare, the effects can often be seen vividly. for example, in many rich countries, up to one third of doctors may be from abroad, many from sub-sahara africa, while many african countries have as little as 500 doctors serving their entire population. reasons for this brain drain vary, ranging from poor conditions domestically to attractive opportunities and active enticement from abroad.read “brain drain of workers from poor to rich countries” to learn more.united nations world summit 2005last updated sunday, september 18, 2005.the un world summit for september 2005 is supposed to review progress since the millennium declaration, adopted by all member states in 2000. however, the us has proposed enormous changes to an outcome document that is to be signed by all members. there are changes on almost all accounts, including striking any mention of the millennium development goals, that aim for example, to halve poverty and world hunger by 2015. this has led to concerns that the outcome document will be weakened. developing countries are also worried about stronger text on human rights and about giving the un security council more powers.read “united

of povertylast updated sunday, september 28, 2014.poverty is the state for the majority of the world’s people and nations. why is this? is it enough to blame poor people for their own predicament?
