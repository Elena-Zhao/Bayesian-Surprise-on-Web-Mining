used in free text searches: (+ plus) stands for and a leading plus sign indicates that this word must be present in each row that is returned. (- minus) stands for not a leading minus sign indicates that this word must not be present in any of the rows that are returned. (no operator) implies or by default (when neither + nor - is specified) the word is optional, but the rows that contain it are rated higher. (" double quote) a phrase that is enclosed within double quote (“"”) characters matches only rows that contain the phrase literally, as it was typed. examples: apple banana find rows that contain at least one of the two words. +apple +juice find rows that contain both words. +apple macintosh find rows that contain the word “apple”, but rank rows higher if they also contain “macintosh”. +apple -macintosh find rows that contain the word “apple” but not “macintosh”. "some words" find rows that contain the exact phrase “some words” (for example, rows that contain “some words of wisdom” but not “some noise words”). note that the “"” characters that enclose the phrase are operator characters that delimit the phrase. they are not the quotation marks that enclose the search string itself. home about us developers services tutorials terms and conditions privacy policy contact us 2014, developmentaid.org all rights reserved
