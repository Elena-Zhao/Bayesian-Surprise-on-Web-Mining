page102550first prevnextforum guidelines - please read chris maunder28-jul-09 2:36when posting your question please:choose the correct forum for your message. posting a vb.net question in the c++ forum will end in tears.be specific! don't ask "can someone send me the code to create an application that does 'x'. pinpoint exactly what it is you need help with.keep the subject line brief, but descriptive. eg "file serialization problem"keep the question as brief as possible. if you have to include code, include the smallest snippet of code you can.be careful when including code that you haven't made a typo. typing mistakes can become the focal point instead of the actual question you asked.do not remove or empty a message if others have replied. keep the thread intact and available for others to search and read. if your problem was answered then edit your message and add "[solved]" to the subject line of the original post, and cast an approval vote to the one or several answers that really helped you.if you are posting source code with your question, place it inside pre/pre tags. we advise you also check the "encode html tags when pasting" checkbox before pasting anything inside the pre block, and make sure "ignore html tags in this message" check box is unchecked.be courteous and don't shout. everyone here helps because they enjoy helping others, not because it's their job.please do not post links to your question in one forum from another, unrelated forum (such as the lounge). it will be deleted.do not be abusive, offensive, inappropriate or harass anyone on the boards. doing so will get you kicked off and banned. play nice.if you have a school or university assignment, assume that your teacher or lecturer is also reading these forums. no advertising or soliciting.we reserve the right to move your posts to a more appropriate forum or to delete anything deemed inappropriate or illegal.when answering a question please:read the question carefullyunderstand that english isn't everyone's first language so be lenient of bad spelling and grammarif a question is poorly phrased then either ask for clarification, ignore it, or mark it down. insults are not welcomeif the question is inappropriate then click the 'vote to remove message' buttoninsults, slap-downs and sarcasm aren't welcome. let's work to help developers, not make them feel

us out here what the underlying storage type you're using is - an array or a list - its pretty ambiguous, so the answer would vary for a list, you could do mylist.remove(0); for an array ? hmmm.. this would copy from the element [1] onwards in the oldarray to element [0] in a newarray - you then have to think about replacing oldarray with newarray .. and, im not sure wether this copies elements or references, or even if it will compile somedatatype[] newarray = new somedatatype[oldarray.length-1];system.arraycopy(oldarray,1,newarray,0,oldarray.length-1);.. but the gist in this case is create a temp array, copy your items to it shuffling 'up' by one element index, then move the data back to the original array have fun (ps - i try not to code in java, so there could be holes big enough to

anything wrong with your code. are you sure that the compilation worked successfully and the class file exists in the directory where you are calling the java command from?sign in·viewthread·permalinkre: error: could not find or load main class oscar06-oct-14 13:18since your main declaration looks correct, it most likely the compile was not successful.look in the directory where you are compiling. see if the file graphexplore.class was created.you will get that message if it is not being created as a result of an error. as a further experiment, try misspelling the name when you run it, you will see that it is the exact same error.sign in·viewthread·permalinkre: error: could not find or load main class torstenh.1-oct-14 21:03eclipse for ubuntu[^]have fun!regards
