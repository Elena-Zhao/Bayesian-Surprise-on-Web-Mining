java tester - what version of java are you running? website bymichael horowitz home javaversion javanews installingjava othertesters javascript about see my defensive computing blog at computerworld.com what version of java are you using? on a computer with multiple web browsers, be sure to check the java version in every browser. i say this because multiple copies of java can sometimes be installed with different browsers using different copies. also, java can be enabled in one browser and disabled in another. note: the portion of java that runs programs is referred to as either the java run-time environment (jre) or the java virtual machine (jvm).method 1: ask javathis is my favorite - straight from the horse's mouth (so to speak). the java run-time environment is aware of its version and the company that authored it. so i wrote a very simple applet (the source code is on the about page) that gets this information from the jre and displays it in a pink rectangle. the version and vendor from the jre if java is working, you will see a pink rectangle above with one line of text that says something like: java version 1.8.0_25 from oracle corporation or java version 1.7.0_67 from oracle corporation or java version 1.6.0_45 from sun microsystems inc. or java version 1.6.0_33 from apple inc. version number translation: 1.6.0_34 is, in english, java 6 update 34 the initial "1" is ignored as is the third digit. ask oracle why. running this applet: java security has changed quite a lot over the years and running this applet has gotten much more complicated. in part this is because the applet is unsigned. in the bizarro world of oracle, unsigned applets are treated as more dangerous than signed applets. this is backwards for two reasons. first, unsigned applets run in a restricted java sandbox whereas signed applets are given unrestricted access to the system. yes, the sandbox has been buggy and broken, but some security is better than none. second, it shows a faith in the certificate authority system that is unwarranted. as of oct 2014 and java 7 update 71 and java 8 update 25, the applet above can be run with java set to the default "high" security level. there will be assorted "as you sure" type prompts both from java and your web browser, but it will run. however, this site, javatester.org, needs to first be added to the "exception site list" using the java control panel. when adding sites to the list, you have to prefix them with http colon slash slash. java will object to http but it will accept it. there is no https version of this site. also, if you add "javatester.org" to the list, you must then go to "javatester.org" as will fail. because it is unsigned, this applet will not run with java set to the "very high" security level. new security in java 7 update 51: january 27, 2014. update 51 changed the default security rules for unsigned java applets such as the one on this page. by default, java no longer runs any unsigned applets. in the java control panel, the default security level with update 51 is "high" which oracle describes as "java applications identified by a certificate from a trusted authority will be allowed to run". what this does not say is that unsigned applets will not run, at least not by default. if you get an error on this page that says "application blocked by security settings" this is probably why. one way to run an unsigned applet is to lower the security level to "medium". the other way is to add trusted websites to a new exception list that oracle/java maintains. this list is not to be confused with the list of trusted applets that firefox or chrome maintains. yes, there are now three lists of applets that are naughty and nice. your browser lies: java 7 update 10 introduced a new checkbox that disables the use of java in all browsers. by and large, this is a good thing, but there seems to be a failure to communicate between java and many web browsers. as a result, all the browsers i have tried so far incorrectly report that java is not installed when, in fact, it may be installed but this new security feature has been enabled. as of java 7 update 71 and java 8 update 25 this is still true on windows machines. interestingly, if java is disabled system-wide for use in web browsers (its on the security) tab, both chrome and firefox will not even show the java plug-in as being installed. on the flip side, firefox 33 on windows 7 reports that "browser has java disabled" when java is not installed. java version history (wikipedia has this too) java 7 (a.k.a version 1.7.x) java 7 was the default for new installations from may 31, 2012 until oct. 14, 2014 java 7 users will be auto-updated to java 8 in early 2015 see the official oracle release history for java 7 as of oct 14, 2014 the latest version of java 7 is a tie!

windows, linux and solaris came from oracle (previously from sun). apple was frequently late in releasing the latest versions of java for os x leaving mac users exposed to known flaws. around august 2012, this changed. while java version 6 for os x still comes from apple exclusively, java version 7 is available from oracle to users running lion and mountain lion. what has not changed is that apple is still late in delivering updates. java 6 update 38 was released by oracle for windows in the middle of dec. 2012. this was written a month later and apple has still not released update 38 for os x. oracle has some technical restrictions for java 7 running on os x. first off, java 7 is only available on an "intel-based mac running mac os x 10.7.3 (lion) or later". in addition, java 7 is not available for chrome because it only supports 64 bit browsers on os x. safari and firefox are supported. in addition, oracle notes that "installing java on a mac is performed on a system wide basis, for all users, and administrator privileges are required. you cannot install java on a single-user basis." for more, see how do i get java support for mac? from oracle. disabling java in os x browsers if a mac user only needs java 6 for an application, they may want to disable it in all their browser(s) using the java preferences app (/applications/utilities/). if a mac user needs java for a website, they may want to disable it in the browser they use most of the time and leave it enabled in another browser used just on the site(s) where java is required. below are instructions to disable java 6 in os x browsers: safari: go to preferences, then security. there is an "enable java" checkbox, turn it off. chrome: in the address bar enter about:plugins without the quotes. find the java plugin (the description is java plug-in 2 for npapi browsers, then click the disable link. firefox: click on tools, then add-ons, then plugins. look for the java deployment toolkit and/or the java platform se and disable them. how to disable java in your mac web browser scared of flashback? here�s how to disable java on your mac and stay safe how to disable the java web plug-in in safari from

selection of a jvm (along with various runtime and security options). you can set the order separately for applications and applets. currently mac users won't have java 6 unless they enable it manually this way.
