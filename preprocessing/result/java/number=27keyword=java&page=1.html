(see portability.) your source program is compiled into what java calls bytecode, which can be run anywhere in a network on a server or client that has a java virtual machine. the java virtual machine interprets the bytecode into code that will run on the real computer hardware. this means that individual computer platform differences such as instruction lengths can be recognized and accommodated locally just as the program is being executed. platform-specific versions of your program are no longer needed. the code is robust, here meaning that, unlike programs written in c++ and perhaps some other languages, the java objects can contain no references to data external to themselves or other known objects. this ensures that an instruction can not contain the address of data storage in another application or in the operating system itself, either of which would cause the program and perhaps the operating system itself to terminate or crash. the java virtual machine makes a number of checks on each object to ensure integrity. java is object-oriented, which means that, among other characteristics, an object can take advantage of being part of a class of objects and inherit code that is common to the class. objects are thought of as nouns that a user might relate to rather than the traditional procedural verbs. a method can be thought of as one of the object's capabilities or behaviors. in addition to being executed at the client rather than the server, a java applet has other characteristics designed to make it run fast. relative to c++, java is easier to learn. (however, it is not a language you'll pick up in an evening!) java was introduced by sun microsystems in 1995 and instantly created a new sense of the interactive possibilities of the web. both of the major web browsers include a java virtual machine. almost all major operating system developers (ibm, microsoft, and others) have added java compilers as part of their product offerings. the java virtual machine includes an optional just-in-time compiler that dynamically compiles bytecode into executable code as an alternative to interpreting one bytecode instruction at a time. in many cases, the dynamic jit compilation is faster than the virtual machine interpretation. javascript should not be confused with java. javascript, which originated at netscape, is interpreted at a higher level, is easier to learn than java, but lacks some of the portability of java and the speed of bytecode. because java applets will run on almost any operating system without requiring recompilation and because java has no operating system-unique extensions or variations, java is generally regarded as the most strategic language in which to develop applications for the web. (however, javascript can be useful for very small applications that run on the web client or server.) stay up to date by receiving the latest it term daily. simply check word of the day to register. this was first published in may 2007 continue reading about java what are the latest java technologies? the home of java is at sun microsystems' java page . glossary java is part of the: programming glossary view all definitions related terms eclipse eclipse is the most widely-used open source integrated development environment. seecompletedefinition html5 html 5 is a revision of the hypertext markup language (html), the standard programming language for describing the contents and ... seecompletedefinition search engine on the internet, a search engine is a coordinated set of programs that includes: a spider (also called a "crawler" or a "bot") ... seecompletedefinition pro+ features enjoy the benefits of pro+ membership, learn more and join. e-handbook api management connects apps and platforms, fosters collaboration e-handbook bpm considerations when making cloud decisions essential guide looking ahead: the future of cloud apps in 2014 and beyond guide sections trends tools and strategies definitions 1comment oldest newest register or login e-mail username / password password forgot your password? by submitting you agree to receive email from techtarget and its partners. if you reside outside of the united states, you consent to having your personal data transferred to and processed in the united states. privacy load more comments forgot password? no problem! submit your e-mail address below. we'll send you an email containing your password. e-mail: submit your password has been sent to: -ads by google file extensions and file formats a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q r s t u v w x y z # powered by: latest techtarget resources software quality cloud applications aws java windows development searchsoftwarequality penetration testing: finding web application flaws though complex, penetration testing is worth the effort and helps make web applications as secure as possible. here are some tips... alpha anywhere brings mobile applications offline see what distinguishes alpha anywhere, a platform that allows developers to quickly create prototypes of potential new ... tackling the whole-team agile approach achieving a whole-team agile approach is hard. here's how one coach took unusual measures to get her team members talking, asking... searchcloudapplications map out an automation strategy with automation passport automation passport's free combination of documents and consultations brings a method to the madness that it automation can be. sap hana marketplace offers experimental approach sap's hana marketplace is growing rapidly, having caught the eye of customers and software developers. startup and veteran ... cloud management services: tips for implementation cloud management services are useful for organizing the ever-growing, complex and sophisticated interconnections within the cloud... searchaws effectively scaling aws apps george lawton reviews the common issues businesses encounter when scaling amazon web services applications. cost of running docker containers vs. aws instances fans of docker claim it has many advantages for application deployment. but how does this translate in aws? we do a trial run to ... demystifying the aws and docker containers hype despite it pros' mixed feelings on docker, there are some advantages to running the containers on aws ec2 instances. we cut ... theserverside bitnami: how a pet project evolved into cloud hosting and server management it's amazing how what was once a pet project that provided simple installers to fellow developers turned into a profitable ... compiling java into javascript with dukescript learn how dukescript will compile java code into javascript and change software development in this video from javaone 2014. dukescript: bridging java to javascript oracle's netbeans platform architect jaroslav tulach discusses how dukescript will bridge java with javascript. searchwindevelopment adopt a collaborative infrastructure strategy cloud vendors are making it easier for it and business people to collaborate on an infrastructure strategy. wapa: what does microsoft offer now? microsoft's windows azure platform appliance integrates private, hybrid and public clouds. choosing the best strategy for silverlight developers learn why many silverlight developers are trying to figure out the best way to transition their existing silverlight applications... about us contact us privacy policy videos photo stories guides advertisers business partners media kit corporate site experts reprints archive site map events e-products all rights reserved, copyright 2001 - 2014, techtarget close
