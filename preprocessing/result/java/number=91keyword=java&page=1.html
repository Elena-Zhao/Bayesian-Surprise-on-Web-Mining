continuous integration (ci) is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently - usually each person integrates at least daily - leading to multiple integrations per day. each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect integration errors as quickly as possible. 3 how do you access your relational data from java? the java language and platform offers a vast range of options when it comes to working with relational data, from raw jdbc to fully blown object/relational mapping (orm) tools. 13 what puzzles you most about functional programming? with so much diversity, it’s hard to define the exact scope of what exactly functional programming is. is it a question of how to design your program, that is, using functions as the primary abstraction? or is it about programming with mathematical functions, meaning pure functions that do not have side effects? and what are those monads again? 6 what's your next language on the javascript platform? javascript vms are mature and ubiquitous - but what's the best language to write code for it?
