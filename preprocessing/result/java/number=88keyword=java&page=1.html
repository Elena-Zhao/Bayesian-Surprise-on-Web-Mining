java time to patch 51 comments 16oct 13 critical java update plugs 51 security holes oracle has released a critical security update that fixes at least 51 security vulnerabilities in its java software. patches are available for linux, mac os x, solaris and windows versions of the software.this update brings java 7 to update 45, and addresses a whole mess of security flaws. oracle says that all but one of the 51 vulnerabilities fixed in this update may be remotely exploitable without authentication.updates are available from java.com and the java control panel. apple has issued an update to its supported version of java, which brings java on the mac to 1.6.0_65 for os x 10.6.8 or later. as cnet notes, apple is using this update to further encourage users to switch to oracles java runtime, especially for web-based java services.when this latest update is installed, according to apples documentation it will remove the apple-supplied java plugin, and result in a missing plug-in section of a web page that tries to run a java applet, cnets topher kessler writes. if you click on the missing plug-in message, the system will direct you to oracles java web site so you can download the latest version of java 7, which will not only support the latest features in the java runtime, but also include the latest bug and vulnerability fixes. apples last supported version of java is java se 6, and since handing the reigns over to oracle, has progressively stepped back from supporting the runtime in os x.broken record alert: if you really need and use java for specific web sites or applications, take a few minutes to update this software. oracle likes to remind everyone that 3 billion devices worldwide run java, and that 89 percent of desktops run some form of java (that roughly matches what vulnerability management firm secunia found last year). but that huge install base combined with a hit parade of security bugs and a component that plugs straight into the web browser makes java software a perennial favorite target of malware and malcontents alike. continue reading a little sunshine 22 comments 4sep 13 researchers: oracles java security fails faced with an onslaught of malware attacks that leverage vulnerabilities and design weaknesses in java, oracle corp. recently tweaked things so that java now warns users about the security risks of running java content. but new research suggests that the integrity and accuracy of these warning messages can be subverted easily in any number of ways, and that oracles new security scheme actually punishes java application developers who adhere to it.javas security dialog box.running a java applet now pops up a security dialog box that presents users with information about the name, publisher and source of the application. oracle says this pop-up is designed to warn users of potential security risks, such as using old versions of java or running applet code that is not signed from a trusted certificate authority.security experts differ over whether regular users pay any mind whatsoever to these warnings. but to make matters worse, new research suggests most of the information contained in the pop-ups can be forged by malware writers.in a series of scathing blog posts, longtime java developer jerry jongerius details the various ways that attackers can subvert the usefulness of these dialog boxes. to illustrate his point, jongerius uses an applet obtained from oracles own web site javadetection.jar and shows that the information in two out of three of its file descriptors (the name and location fields) can be changed, even if the applet is already cryptographically signed.the bottom line in all of this is not the security risk of the errors but that oracle made such incredibly basic 101 type errors in allowing unsigned information into their security dialogs, jongerius wrote in an email exchange. the magnitude of that fail is huge.jongerius presents the following scenario in which an attacker might use the dialog boxes to trick users into running unsafe applets:imagine a hacker taking a real signed java application for remote desktop control / assistance, and placing it on a gaming site, renaming it chess. an unsuspecting end user would get a security popup from java asking if they want to run chess, and because they do, answer yes but behind the scenes, the end users computer is now under the remote control of a hacker (and maybe to throw off suspicion, implemented a basic chess in html5 so it looks like that applet worked) all because oracle allowed the name in security dialogs to be forged to something innocent and incorrect.oracle has not responded to requests for comment. but jongerius is hardly the only software expert crying foul about the companys security prompts. will dormann, writing for the carnegie mellon universitys software engineering institute, actually warns java developers against adopting a key tenet of oracles new security guidelines. continue reading a little sunshine 11 comments 15aug 13 personalized exploit kit targets researchers as documented time and again on this blog, cybercrooks are often sloppy or lazy enough to leave behind important clues about who and where they are. but from time to time, cheeky crooks will dream up a trap designed to look like theyre being sloppy when in fact theyre trying to trick security researchers into being sloppy and infecting their computers with malware.a nuclear exploit pack administrative panel made to serve malware.according to peter kruse, a partner and cybercrime specialist with csis security group, thats what happened late last month when a twitter user paunchbighecker started messaging security researchers on twitter. paunch the nickname of a russian hacker who for the past few years has sold the wildly popular blackhole exploit kit, a crimeware package designed to be stitched into hacked or malicious sites and foist browser exploits on visitors. the person behind paunchbighecker twitter account probably figured that invoking paunchs name and reputation would add to the allure of his scam.the paunchbighecker twitter account appears to have been created on july 30 for the sole purpose of sending tweets to several security researchers, including this author, mikko hypponen of finnish security firm f-secure, french malware researcher kafeine, polish security researcher tachion24, and secobsecurity. strangely enough, the other twitter account that received messages from this user belongs to sauli niinistö, the current president of finland.the link that paunchbighecker sent to researchers displays what appears to be the back-end administrative panel for a nuclear pack exploit kit. in fact, the landing page was a fake merely made to look like a nuclear pack statistics panel. rather, embedded inside the page itself is a series of active java exploits. update, 1:56 p.m.: security researcher kafeine said he does not believe this was an attack against security researchers, but rather an intentional leak of badguy credentials.  furthermore, kafeine notes that visitors to the site link in the twitter messages would have to take an additional step in order to infect their own computers. continue reading a little sunshine / latest warnings / web fraud 2.0 18 comments 8jul 13 styx exploit pack: domo arigato, pc roboto not long ago, miscreants who wanted to buy an exploit kit automated software that helps booby-trap hacked sites to deploy malicious code   had to be fairly well-connected, or at least have access to semi-private underground forums. these days, some exploit kit makers are brazenly advertising and offering their services out in the open, marketing their wares as browser vulnerability stress-test platforms.styx pack victims, by browser and os version.aptly named after the river in greek mythology that separates mere mortals from the underworld, the styx exploit pack is a high-end software package that is made for the underground but marketed and serviced at the public styx-crypt[dot]com. the purveyors of this malware-as-a-service also have made a 24 hour virtual help desk available to paying customers.styx customers might expect such niceties for the $3,000 price tag that accompanies this kit. a source with access to one styx kit exploit panel that was apparently licensed by a team of bad guys shared a glimpse into their operations and the workings of this relatively slick crimeware offering.the styx panel i examined is set up for use by a dozen separate user accounts, each of which appears to be leveraging the pack to load malware components that target different moneymaking schemes. the account named admin, for example, is spreading an executable file that tries to install the reveton ransomware.other user accounts appear to be targeting victims in specific countries. for example, the user accounts it and it2 are pushing variants of the zeus banking trojan, and according to this styx panels statistics page, italy was by far the largest source of traffic to the malicious domains used by these two accounts. additional apparently country-focused accounts included nl, auss, and adultamer (amer is a derisive russian slur used to describe americans).zeus trojan variants targeted at italian victims were detected by fewer than 5 out 17 antivirus tools.an exploit kit also called an exploit pack (styx is marketed as styx pack) is a software toolkit that gets injected into hacked or malicious sites, allowing the attacker to foist a kitchen sink full of browser exploits on visitors. those visiting such sites with outdated browser plugins may have malware silently installed.unlike other kits, styx doesnt give a detailed breakdown of the exploits used in the panel. rather, the panel i looked at referred to its bundled exploits by simple two-digit numbers. this particular styx installation used just four browser exploits, all but one of which targets recent vulnerabilities in java. the kit referred to each exploit merely by the numbers 11, 12, 13 and 32.according to the considerable legwork done by kafeine, a security blogger who digs deeply into exploit kit activity, styx kit exploit #11 is likely to be cve-2013-1493, a critical flaw in a java browser plugin that java maker oracle fixed with an emergency patch in march 2013. exploit 12 is almost certainly cve-2013-2423, another critical java bug that oracle patched in april 2013. in an instant message chat, kafeine says exploit #13 is probably cve-2013-0422, a critical java vulnerability that was patched in january 2013. the final exploit used by the kit i examined, number 32, maps to cve-2011-3402, the same microsoft windows font flaw exploited by the duqu trojan.the styx stats page reports that the hacked and malicious sites used by this kit have been able to infect roughly one out of every 10 users who visited the sites. this particular styx installation was set up on june 24, 2013, and since that time it has infected approximately 13,300 windows pcs all via just those  four vulnerabilities (but mostly the java bugs). continue reading time to patch 22 comments 16apr 13 java update plugs 42 security holes oracle corp. today released an update for its java se software that fixes at least 42 security flaws in the widely-installed program and associated browser plugin. the java update also introduces new features designed to alert users about the security risks of running certain java content.java 7 update 21 contains 42 new security fixes for oracle java se. a majority of these flaws are browse-toa-hacked-site-and-get-infected vulnerabilities. according to oracle, 39 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without the need for a username and password [emphasis mine].there does not appear to be any update for java 6. oracle was to stop shipping security fixes for java 6 in february, but it broke from that schedule last month when it shipped an emergency update for java 6 to fix a flaw that was being used in active attacks. when i updated a machine running the latest java 6 version (update 43) it prompted me to install java 7 update 21. update, 5:42 p.m. et: twitter follower @donaldojdk notes that java 6 update 45 is indeed available here.java 7 update 21 also introduces some new security warnings and message prompts for users who keep the program plugged into a web browser (on installation and updating, java adds itself as an active browser plugin). oracle said the messages that will be presented depend upon different risk factors, such as using old versions of java or running applet code that is not signed from a trusted certificate authority.apps that present a lower risk display a simple informational message. this includes an option to prevent showing similar messages for apps from the same publisher in the future. java applications considered to be higher risk such as those that use an untrusted or expired certificate will be accompanied by a prompt with a yellow exclamation point in a yellow warning triangle. continue reading a little sunshine / breadcrumbs 37 comments 8apr 13 phoenix exploit kit author arrested in russia? the creator of a popular crimeware package known as the phoenix exploit kit was arrested in his native russia for distributing malicious software and for illegally possessing multiple firearms, according to underground forum posts from the malware author himself.the last version of the phoenix exploit kit. source: xylibox.comthe phoenix exploit kit is a commercial crimeware tool that until fairly recently was sold by its maker in the underground for a base price of $2,200. it is designed to booby-trap hacked and malicious web sites so that they foist drive-by downloads on visitors.like other exploit packs, phoenix probes the visitors browser for the presence of outdated and insecure versions of browser plugins like java, and adobe flash and reader. if the visitor is unlucky enough to have fallen behind in applying updates, the exploit kit will silently install malware of the attackers choosing on the victims pc (phoenix targets only microsoft windows computers).the author of phoenix a hacker who uses the nickname alexudakov on several forums does not appear to have been overly concerned about covering his tracks or hiding his identity. and as well see in a moment, his online persona has been all-too-willing to discuss his current legal situation with former clients and fellow underground denizens.exploit.in forum member alexudakov selling his phoenix exploit kit.for example, alexudakov was a member of darkode.com, a fairly exclusive english-language cybercrime forum that i profiled last week. that post revealed that the administrator accounts for darkode had been compromised in a recent break-in, and that the intruders were able to gain access to private communications of the administrators. that access included authority to view full profiles of darkode members, as well as the private email addresses of darkode members.alexudakov registered at darkode using the address nrew89@gmail.com. that email is tied to a profile at vkontakte.ru (a russian version of facebook) for one andrey alexandrov, a 23-year-old male (born may 20, 1989) from yoshkar-ola, a historic city of about a quarter-million residents situated on the banks of the malaya kokshaga river in russia, about 450 miles east of moscow.aks-74u rifles. source: wikimedia commons.that nrew89@gmail.com address also is connected to accounts at several russian-language forums and web sites dedicated to discussing guns, including talk.guns.ru and popgun.ru. this is interesting because, as i was searching alexudakovs phoenix exploit kit sales postings on various cybercrime forums, i came across him discussing guns on one of his sales threads at exploit.in, a semi-exclusive underground forum. there, a user with the nickname alexudakov had been selling phoenix exploit kit for many months, until around july 2012, when customers on exploit.in began complaining that he was no longer responding to sales and support requests. meanwhile, alexudakov account remained silent for many months.then, in february 2013, alexudakov began posting again, explaining his absence by detailing his arrest by the federal security service (fsb), the russian equivalent of the fbi. the phoenix exploit kit author explained that he was arrested by fsb officers for distributing malware and the illegal possession of firearms, including two aks-74u assault rifles, a glock, a tt (russian-made pistol), and a pm (also known as a makarov). continue reading a little sunshine / breadcrumbs / the coming storm 75 comments 3apr 13 who wrote the flashback os x worm? a year ago today, apple released a software update to halt the spread of the flashback worm, a malware strain that infected more than 650,000 mac os x systems using a vulnerability in apples version of java. this somewhat dismal anniversary is probably as good a time as any to publish some clues ive gathered over the past year that point to the real-life identity of the flashback worms creator.before i delve into the gritty details, a little background on this insidious contagion is in order. a keenly detailed research paper (pdf) published last year by finnish security firm f-secure puts the impact and threat from flashback in perspective, noting that the malware boasted a series of firsts for its kind. for starters, flashback was the first os x malware to be vmware aware or to know when it was being run in a virtual environment (a trick designed to frustrate security researchers). it also was the first to disable xprotect, os xs built-in malware protection program. these features, combined with its ability to spread through a then-unpatched vulnerability in java made flashback roughly as common for macs as the conficker worm was for windows pcs.this means flashback is not only the most advanced, but also the most successful os x malware weve ever seen, wrote f-secures broderick ian aquilino.the f-secure writeup answers an important question not found in other analyses: namely, what was the apparent intended purpose of flashback? put simply: to redirect google results to third-party advertisers, all for the authors profit. its name was derived from the fact that it spread using a social engineering trick of presenting the os x user with a bogus flash player installation prompt. f-secure notes that this same behavior both the flash social engineering trick and the redirection to fake google sites that served search results for third-party advertisers that benefited the author was also found in the qhost malware, suggesting that flashback may have been the next evolution of the mac qhost malware.black seoa year ago, i published a series that sought to identify the real-life hackers behind the top spam botnets. using much the same methodology, i was able to identify and locate a young man in russia who appears (and privately claims) to be the author of flashback. as it happens, this individual hangs out on many of the same forums as the worlds top spammers (but more on that at another time).given flashbacks focus on gaming googles ad networks, i suspected that the worms author probably was a key member of forums that focus on so-called black hat seo, (search engine optimization), or learned in illicit ways to game search engines and manipulate ad revenues. sure enough, this individual happens to be a very active and founding member of blackseo.com, a closely guarded russian language forum dedicated to this topic.below is a screen shot taken from a private message between a vip user named mavook and a top forum member on blackseo.com. the conversation took place on july 14, 2012. a rough translation of their conversation is superimposed on the redacted screen grab, but basically it shows mavook asking the senior member for help in gaining access to darkode.com, a fairly exclusive english-language cybercrime forum (and one that i profiled in a story earlier this week).blackseo.com member mavook claims responsibility for creating flashback to a senior forum member.mavook asks the other member to get him an invitation to darkode, and mavook is instructed to come up with a brief bio stating his accomplishments, and to select a nickname to use on the forum if hes invited. mavook replies that the darkode nick should be not be easily tied back to his blackseo persona, and suggests the nickname macbook. he also states that he is the creator of flashback botnet for macs, and that he specializes in finding exploits and creating bots. continue reading a little sunshine / breadcrumbs / the coming storm 72 comments 2apr 13 fool me once when youre lurking in the computer crime underground, it pays to watch your back and to keep your bs meter set to  maximum. but when youve gained access to an elite black market section of a closely guarded crime forum to which very few have access, its easy to let your guard down. thats what i did earlier this year, and it caused me to chase a false story. this blog post aims to set the record straight on that front, and to offer a cautionary (and possibly entertaining) tale to other would-be cybersleuths.on jan. 16, 2013, i published a post titled, new java exploit fetches $5,000 per buyer. the details in that story came from a sales thread posted to an exclusive subforum of darkode.com, a secretive underground community that has long served as a bazaar for all manner of cybercriminal wares, including exploit kits, spam services, ransomware programs, and stealthy botnets. ive maintained a presence on this forum off and on (mostly on) for the past three years, in large part because darkode has been a reliable place to find information about zero-days, or highly valuable threats that exploit previously unknown vulnerabilities in software threats that are shared or used by attackers before the developer of the target software knows about the vulnerability.i had previously broken several other stories about zero-day exploits for sale on darkode that later showed up in-the-wild and confirmed by the affected vendors, and this sales thread was posted by one of the forums most trusted members. the sales thread also was created during a time in which javas maker oracle corp. was struggling with multiple zero-days in java.what i didnt know at the time was that this particular sales thread was little more than a carefully laid trap by the darkode administrators to discover which accounts i was using to lurk on their forum. ironically, i recently learned of this snare after white/grey hat hackers compromised virtually all of the administrator accounts and private messages on darkode.looks like krebs swallowed the bait, and i got an idea how to catch him now for the next thread, wrote darkode administrator mafi in a jan. 16 private message to a co-admin who uses the nickname sp3cial1st.following this post, the administrators compared notes as to which users had viewed the fake java zero-day sales thread during the brief, two-day period it was live on a restricted portion of darkode. i have taken a careful examination of the logs related to the java 0day thread, sp3cial1st wrote to a darkode administrator who used the nick 187. continue reading time to patch 26 comments 20feb 13 critical security updates for adobe reader, java adobe and oracle each released updates to fix critical security holes in their software. adobes patch plugs two zero-day holes that hackers have been using to break into computers via adobe reader and acrobat. separately, oracle issued updates to correct at least five security issues with java.the java update comes amid revelations by apple, facebook and twitter that employees at these organizations were hacked using exploits that attacked java vulnerabilities on mac and windows machines. according to bloomberg news, at least 40 companies were targeted in malware attacks linked to an eastern european gang of hackers that has been trying to steal corporate secrets.oracles update brings java on windows systems to java se 7 update 15, and java 6 update 41. most consumers can get by without java installed, or least not plugged into the browser. because of the prevalence of threats targeting java installations, id urge these users to remove java or unplug it from the browser. if this is too much trouble, consider adopting a dual-browser approach, keeping java unplugged from your main browser, and plugged in to a secondary browser that you only use to visit sites that require the plugin. to find out if you have java installed, visit java.com and click the do i have java? link below the big red button. existing users can update java from the java control panel, clicking the update tab and then the update now button.apple has issued an update that brings java up-to-date on security patches but also disables the java plugin from web browsers on the system. apple also issued a malware removal tool that it said should remove from macs the most common variants of malware that used the most recent java exploits. continue reading

browsing the web with outdated versions of java, yahoo! is pushing many of its users in the other direction: the free tool that it offers users to help build web sites installs a dangerously insecure version of java that is more than four years old.yahoo! users who decide to build a web site within the internet firms hosting environment are steered toward using a free tool called sitebuilder, which is designed to make building simple web sites a point-and-click exercise. yahoo! has offered sitebuilder to its millions of users for years, but unfortunately the tool introduces a myriad of security vulnerabilities on host pcs.sitebuilder requires java, but the version of java that yahoo!  bundles with it is java 6 update 7. its not clear if this is just a gross oversight or if their tool really doesnt work with more recent versions of java. the company has yet to respond to requests for comment.but this version of java was first introduced in the summer of 2008 and is woefully insecure and out-of-date. oracle just released java 6, update 39, meaning that sitebuilder installs a version of java that includes hundreds of known, critical security vulnerabilities that can be used to remotely compromise host pcs. continue reading older entries advertisement pre-order spam nation due out nov. 18, 2014click image for more details. recent posts krebsonsecurity honored for
