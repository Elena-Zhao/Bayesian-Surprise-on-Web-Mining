in this browser java security news october 31, 2014: i blogged about whats new with java. perhaps the big news here is that a "very high" security level setting for java does not prevent unsigned applets from running. tested on windows 7 with both java 7 and 8. also, just what does it mean when the java runtime expires. october 14, 2014: oracle released three new versions of java: version 7 update 71, version 7 update 72 and version 8 update 25. also, version 8 update 25 is now the default for new installations. java 8 should work on windows xp but oracle does not officially support it. october 14, 2014: java version 7 is scheduled to die on april 2015. aug 4, 2014: java version 7 update 67 was released. no security related bugs were fixed. one non security bug was fixed. july 15, 2014: java version 7 update 65 (a.k.a. version 1.7.0_65) was released to fix 20 security related bugs. see the release notes for update 65 and the list of bugs. july 14, 2014: it was reported that java 7 would no longer be supported on windows xp. this is not true, java 7 will continue to be supported on xp. however, java 8 will not be supported on xp. may 29, 2014: java version 7 update 60 (a.k.a. version 1.7.0_60) was released. although it contains a large number of bug fixes, none of them seem to be security related. the security baseline remains update 55. see the release notes for update 60. may 29, 2014: the number of bugs in java keeps increasing. according to greg sinclair,there were 58 java flaws in 2010, 65 in 2011, 68 in 2012 and a whopping 208 in 2013. april 15, 2014: java version 7 update 55 (a.k.a. version 1.7.0_55) was released to fix 37 bugs. see the release notes. march 18, 2014: java version 8 was released. it is not yet offered by default. it can be downloaded here and here. older news... about java (last revisions: oct. 16, 2013 | jan 25,2013 |jan 15,2013 | oct 2012java is supported on windows, os x and linux. it is not supported in ios or chrome os. java is very much involved in android, but not in a way that is visible to end users.java is used both online and offline in windows, os x and linux. the online use involves java programs, typically referred to as "applets", embedded in a web page. all the security issues regarding java involve applets. offline, java is used by applications installed in your operating system. examples of these applications are below in the "do you need java" section. the topic of java being used in a web browser vs. an installed application was addressed by steve gibson on the jan 16, 2013 edition of his security now podcast (do a find for "jared").a component of java has to be installed on a computer before java programs can execute, either online or offline. this component has a couple names. it was initially referred to as the java virtual machine (jvm), but now the more common term is jre (java runtime environment). sometimes, it is just referred to as java, which is a big misnomer as there are many parts to the java ecosystem.the latest edition of java is version 7. it comes from oracle and is supported on windows, os x and linux. oracle gave up issuing bug fixes for java version 6 in the middle of 2013 (for free that is; you can pay oracle for java 6 bug fixes). apple continues to issues bug fixes for java 6 on snow leopard, lion and mountain lion. on windows, the java runtime (jre) may or may not be pre-installed, the decision is left up to the hardware manufacturer. a java version 6 runtime was pre-installed by apple on os x leopard and snow leopard, but starting with lion, apple stopped pre-installing java. java 6 can be installed on lion and mountain lion, but it will not run applets. java 7 can be installed on lion and mountain lion to run applets. java 7 can not be installed on snow leopard. lion and mountain can have both java 6 and java 7 installed concurrently.the java runtime (jre) on windows comes from oracle (previously from sun). on os x, apple supplies the jre for java version 6, while oracle supplies the jre for java version 7. oracle is the official supplier of the jre for linux, but there are also other sources available. microsoft used to maintain their own jre on windows but that fell by the wayside long ago. in the old days netscape had their own jre as did ibm and others.just because a java runtime is installed, does not mean that a web browser will actually use it. there are three possible reasons for this: the use of java may be disabled in any one browser. the only exception here is internet explorer which, despite what you may read online, is not capable of totally severing its connection to java.starting with java 7 update 10, the use of java online by all installed web browsers can be disabled with a new checkbox in the security section of the java control panel. to date, my experience has been that while this works, web browsers incorrectly report that java is not installed at all.the web browser may be architecturally unable to run java. one example of this is chrome on os x lion and mountain when java 7 is installed (it is a 32 bit vs. 64 bit issue). another example is the tile world version of internet explorer 10 on windows 8 which does not support any plug-ins. advanced button. there should be a checkbox to "automatically update safe downloads list". currently java has a poor reputation for an endless stream of security flaws. but well before this, apple and microsoft did not like java because it made their operating systems less important. a java program can, in theory, run equally well on windows, os x and linux. and, that's just for starters. as long as there is a jre for an operating system, java programs can run on that system. this opens up other environments too, such as ibm mainframes and unix. the popular phrase, in the early days of java was "write once, run anywhere". but, it all went wrong, well before security flaws became the main java story. as it played out over the years, flash beat out java in the marketplace on the client side (your computer). flash served the same cross platform needs that java was intended for. there were annoying differences between java runtimes from different vendors which led to the sarcastic phrase "write once, debug everywhere." it may be that flash won out simply because there was only one source (adobe now, macromedia initially) for its runtime environment. on the server side however, java has always been popular. java programs are prepared for execution in the jvm/jre by being translated into something called java bytecode. the java runtime environment doesn't really care about, or deal with, the java programming language, it takes java bytecode as input. this, along with assorted advantages to using a jvm, has led to other programming languages also being translated into java bytecode so that they can be run in a java virtual machine. in sept. 2013 wired reported on two such popular languages, clojure and scala. a version of ruby known as jruby also runs in a jvm. wired reported that twitter runs entirely inside jvms mostly using software written in scala but also some written in java. linkedin is also married to jvms and uses a mixture of java and scala.now that security flaws are the big issue with java, the safest best practice is to un-install java and see if anything breaks. i say this because, as far as i know, there is no inventory function that reports on java usage system-wide. since all the security issues have been with java applets embedded in web pages, someone that only needs java for installed applications, should disable its use in all browsers using a security feature first introduced in java 7 update 10 (see oracles instructions). someone needing to run java applets should normally use a web browser that has java disabled and use a second browser, with java enabled, exclusively on the site(s) that need java. if you are not sure which sites use java, google's chrome browser is your friend, as it warns before running java applets. the version page of this site verifies that a browser is capable of running java applets in web pages by running a very simple applet that displays the version of java. it also has a history of java releases and instructions for disabling java in assorted browsers. the source code for the applet is on the about page. java applets can, optionally, be digitally signed. those that are not, started generating a new pop-up warning with the introduction of java 7 update 11. the "version" applet on this site is not signed. neither are those from oracle that test if java is working (here and here). finally, you may see oracle mention the java security baseline. this refers to the latest version of java that contains no security flaws. this is not necessarily the latest version. there is a different security baseline edition for java 6 and 7. to illustrate, as of mid-january 2013, update 37 was the security baseline edition for java 6. windows users had access to update 38 which contained bug fixes, but no security related bug fixes. apple did not produce an update 38 for the mac, they maxed out at update 37. my blogsi have written about java a few times in my defensive computing blog at computerworld. whats new with java october 31, 2014. about: 3 latest versions of java, turning off ssl

using a jvm from microsoft (no longer). netscape 7 used a jvm from sun. netscape 4.x used a jvm from netscape.thinkpads for the last few years (at least) ship with a jvm from ibm.terminology (revised january 15, 2013) in the beginning, java programs embedded in web pages were called applets. that's the term i use on this site because it was created long ago. now however, things are more complicated. according to oracle, java programs running inside a browser "includes plugin applets, java web start applications, embedded javafx applications, and access to the native deployment toolkit plugins". windows users may find the term applet used to describe the small applications in the control panel (power options, mouse options, administrative tools, etc.). these control panel thingies have nothing to do with java, other than the java one, which is referred to as the java control panel.java applets can be digitally signed. those that are not are referred to as "unsigned", "untrusted" and "sandboxed". javascript is separate and distinct from java. no relationship at all. your web browser does not support iframes, so you can not see the page counters website created and maintained by michael horowitz mh _at_ javatester.org site stats java and javascript are trademarks of oracle in the us and other countries. this site is independent of oracle. page: last updated:
