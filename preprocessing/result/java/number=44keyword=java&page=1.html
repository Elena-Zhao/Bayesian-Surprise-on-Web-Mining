evolved from a language named oak. oak was developed in the earlynineties at sun microsystems as a platform-independent language aimed atallowing entertainment appliances such as video game consoles and vcrs tocommunicate . oak was first slated to appear in television set-top boxesdesigned to provide video-on-demand services. oak was unsuccessful so in 1995sun changed the name to java and modified the language to take advantage of theburgeoning world wide web.java is an object-oriented language, and this is verysimilar to c++. java programming language is simplified to eliminate languagefeatures that cause common programming errors. java source code files arecompiled into a format called bytecode, which can then be executed by a javainterpreter. if you are beginner read how

programming language. remember, we cannot use these keywords as identifiers in the program. the keywords const and goto are reserved though, they are not being currently used. java data types java programming language is a language in which all the variables must be declared first and then to be used i.e. to specify the name and the type of the variable. this specifies that java is a strongly-typed programming language literals by literal we mean any number, text, or other information that represents a value. this means what you type is what you get. we will use literals in addition to variables in java statement. while writing a source code as a character sequence, we can specify any value as a literal such as an integer. arrays in this section you will be introduced to the concept of arrays in java programming language. you will learn how the array class in java helps the programmer to organize the same type of data into easily manageable format. operators operators are symbols that performs some operations on one or more then one operands. once we declare and initialize variables, we can use operators to perform certain tasks like addition, subtraction etc. controlling your program we all know that the execution of the statements in a program takes place from top to bottom. we will learn how the different kinds of statement have different effects in looping like decision-making statements (if-then, if-then-else, switch), the looping statements (for, while, do-while), and the branching statements (break, continue, return) in java programming language. java classes in this section you will be introduced to some essential classes in java like exceptions, basic i/o, concurrency etc. class inheritance to know the concept of inheritance clearly you must have the idea of class and its features like methods, data members, access controls, constructors, keywords this, super etc. summary you have been introduced to the contents of java language providing a great amount of information. perhaps it would be a bit arduous to grasp the whole lot of things at one go. however, the implementation of these little basics will make you a substantial programmer. related java tutorials/articles java tutorial and articles here you will find articles related to the java programming language. some of the articles are: deadlocks in java,
