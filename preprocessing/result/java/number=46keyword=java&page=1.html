the java programming languagethe java programming languageclick below to go directly to a specific section:history | significant language features | areas of application | sample programs related links | printed references | acknowledgements historythe java programming language evolved from a language named oak. oak was developed inthe early nineties at sun microsystems as a platform-independent language aimed atallowing entertainment appliances such as video game consoles and vcrs to communicate .oak was first slated to appear in television set-top boxes designed to providevideo-on-demand services. just as the deals with the set-top box manufacturers werefalling through, the world wide web was coming to life. as oaks developers began tore cognize this trend, their focus shifted to the internet and webrunner, an oak-enabledbrowser, was born. oaks name was changed to java and webrunner became the hotjavaweb browser. the excitement of the internet attracted software vendors such that jav adevelopment tools from many vendors quickly became available. that same excitement hasprovided the impetus for a multitude of software developers to discover java and its manywonderful features. significant language features platform independence - java compilers do not produce native object code for a particular platform but rather byte code instructions for the java virtual machine (jvm). making java code work on a particular platform is then sim ply a matter of writing a byte code interpreter to simulate a jvm. what this all means is that the same compiled byte code will run unmodified on any platform that supports java. object orientation - java is a pure object-oriented language. this means that everything in a java program is an object and everything is descended from a root object class. rich standard library - one of javas most attractive features is its standard library. the java environment includes hundreds of classes and methods in six major functional areas. language support classes for advanced language features such as strings, arrays, threads, and exception handling. utility classes like a random number generator, date and time functions, and container classes. input/output classes to read and write data of many types to and from a variety of sources. networking classes to allow inter-computer communications over a local network or the internet. abstract window toolkit for creating platform-independent gui applications. applet is a class that lets you create java programs that can be downloaded and run on a client browser. applet interface - in addition to being able to create stand-alone applications, java developers can create programs that can downloaded from a web page and run on a client browser. familiar c++-like syntax - one of the factors enabling the rapid adoption of java is the similarity of the java syntax to that of the popular c++ programming language. garbage collection - java does not require programmers to explicitly free dynamically allocated memory. this makes java programs easier to write and less prone to memory errors. areas of application world wide web applets cross-platform application development other network applications sample programs hello world! gui widget demo calculator language interpreter simple graphics canvas boardrelated links sun microsystems' javasoft division - here you can find general news and information, extensive documentation, and the downloadable java developers kit which allows you to start writing your own programs. toylab - website featuring java games - this site is a technical computing portal for all scientific and engineering needs. the portal is free and contains over 20,000 useful links to technical computing programmers, covering fortran, excel, java, matlab and others. thinking in java - java web site and free java textbook (pdf). earthweb's gamelan java directory - the most complete collection of java resources. java applet review service - the java applet review service indexes and rates java applets. java applications for websites - aritcles, api's applets and more for websites. free java applets - cool free applets for the taking. java applications (how to) ibm guidelines for writing applications using java. blue jay free java ide for solaris and windows.printed references chan, patrick and lee, rosanna (1996). the java class libraries: an annotated reference (java series). addison-wesley publishing co. daconta, michael c.
