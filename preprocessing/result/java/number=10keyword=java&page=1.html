java, near bogor prambanan - remarkable ancient hindu temple sukamade - turtles come to lay their eggs virtually every night of the year ujung kulon national park - amazing national park with unspoiled jungles, white sand beaches, corals and the last examples of the javanese rhinoceros talk[edit]while indonesian (bahasa indonesia) is the lingua franca understood by almost everyone, the majority of java's population also speak javanese, a related but mutually incomprehensible language. as the largest single language in indonesia, javanese influence on bahasa indonesia has been quite significant, and particularly in central and east java you'll even hear the local pronunciation change the most notable change is a turning into o, so eg. surabaya becomes suroboyo.other significant local languages include sundanese, spoken in west java, betawi in jakarta and madurese, spoken on and around the island of madura.get in[edit]by air[edit]most visitors arrive at jakarta, bandung, semarang, surabaya, solo and yogyakarta. there are several domestic airlines such as garuda, merpati, lion air, mandala, sriwijaya air. international airlines: airasia, sq, qantas, mas, cathay pacific, pal, thai international, jal, kal, eva air, air india, etc.by sea[edit]pt angkutan sungai danau dan penyeberangan/asdp ferry services: gianyar(bali) from/to gilimanuk (east java) bakauheni

medan (north sumatra) from/to tanjung priok (jakarta) pontianak (west kalimantan) from/to tanjung priok (jakarta) makassar (south sulawesi) from/to tanjung perak (surabaya)get around[edit]java's infrastructure is by far the best in indonesia, and it's possible to cross the entire island by land in a single (long) day. however, the sheer density of population means that roads can get overcrowded if you're moving at the same time as everyone else.by bus[edit]the main form of long-distance transport, vast armadas of buses cross the island and connect every city and mountain hamlet. watch out though, as many drivers have near-suicidal driving habits that emphasize speed above all else. the eksekutif bus is comfortable enough, provided with ac, reclining seats, and toilet in some eksekutif bus. some big cities have several terminals.by travel[edit]the point to point travel uses various minibuses with 6 to 11 passengers. some cities have many points, you should go from one point, but can stop before the arrival point, so please check the points and the routes. you can booking about 2 weeks in advance by telephone without any payment first. it is faster than bus, but bus is more comfortable for the long legs.by train[edit]java has the best railway network in indonesia, with trains connecting the capital city of jakarta with most other cities and towns in the island. the eksekutif class is the best class, and consequently the most expensive. ticket reservations can be made starting 90 days in advance. on-line ticket reservation is available on pt kereta api's ticketing site [1]. you can pay in the website or just get booking code and pay at thousands of indomaret and alfamart stores around indonesia without any additional fee. you can also make reservation and pay directly without booking at the stores. the system is similar with plane ticket reservation, so different date or time and when you're booking will give different (but slight different) price tickets, moreover you can choose your seat when reservation.by road[edit]java's toll roads are built nearly to western standards, with dual grade-separated lanes in both directions and elevated interchanges. tolls are quite affordable, usually rp 1,000-5,000 every 10 km or so. however, signage is often lacking and driving habits are atrocious, so it's very wise to pay a little extra and get a car with driver instead of attempting to drive yourself.by air[edit]low cost carriers make some destinations is seems not expensive. please check the price and compare to bus, travel and train ticket prices and also the time consume. airplanes ticket for peak season (lebaran, christmas and holiday) ussually is double than low season price, but ticket price for bus, travel and train is relatively stable (only low increase in peak season).see[edit][add listing] typical central java scenery with mount merapi and mount merbabu looming largejava offers everything a somewhat adventurous traveler is looking for: two of world's great ancient monuments, volcanoes (all 121 of them), major national parks, rainforests, tea and rice plantations, large cities, big waves and even savanna. the scenery in most parts of java is spectacular and, while the island is overpopulated, there are still plenty of unspoiled places. even though the beaches are not very appealing in java and tides can be fatal especially in south part of java, in nearby archipelagos like pulau seribu or karimunjawa the traveler can find white sand beaches and corals islands.do[edit][add listing] trek in ujung kulon

water or water from a sealed bottle. coffee or tea. it's safe. the same applies to bir bintang, which combines very well with a hot indonesian dish.stay safe[edit]use common sense, as you would do in your own country. most common is (fortunately) theft, violent crime is rare in indonesia. however, it's wise to be extra cautious in jakarta and other big cities (see also wikitravel: jakarta section). avoid crowds.traffic can be chaotic. watch out for trucks, cars and other moving objects. one rule applies: "might is right". don't expect traffic to respect pedestrian ("zebra") crossings (even when a police(wo)man is in sight). when crossing a busy street - be confident, make sure your intentions are clear to the oncoming drivers. cars never stop, but if they know what they can expect from you, they will avoid you. using hand signal like put one hand in the air or signaling stop might help, too.this is a usable article. it gives a good overview of the region, its sights, and how to
