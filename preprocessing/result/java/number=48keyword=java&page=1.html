if you have installed vuze but it is crashing or behaving strangely (eg. no windows display after the program launches) you possibly need to upgrade your java. the latest official java is version 7u3 (1.7.0_03) as of march 2012. the latest version of the still common java 6 is update 31 (1.6.0_31) as of march 2012. this is also the version offered by java's update system. you can verify from sun's web pages that you have the newest java installed: detect java version manual download: (still java 6 as of march 2012) java 7: java[edit]you must be running as an administrator to be able to install java successfully. if your regular user account is a limited user (following the best practices for safe computing), you will need to temporarily switch the account to an administrative user in order to install java successfully. after java is installed on that account, you can switch that account back to a limited user account.java troubleshooting issues[edit]outdated java[edit]you should update to the newest java, either through the java's built-in update checker (launched from control panel -- java), or by the manual install process described below.hit the windows-key and r, enter cmd /k java -version and hit ok to find out which jre is currently installed (or visit sun java web pages: detect java version)if your version is not the latest (see above), download it from sun click on download jre 6 on the next page, read the license agreement and click accept if you accept it (you must accept it to continue) then click on windows offline installation, multi-language pay careful attention to where you save the file.shut down azureusuninstall every java you may find in start-settings-control panel-add/remove programsreboot your pc (it's very important! don't skip this!)install the latest java jremore than one java installed[edit]sun says that you are able to have multiple jre versions installed, but in case you experience problems there, you might remove older versions.if you should already have the latest java version check start/programs to see if there's more than one j2se runtime environment.shut down vuze uninstall every java you may find in start-settings-control panel-add/remove programsreboot your pcinstall the latest java againazureus.exe/vuze.exe fails to launch with a 'could not create jvm' error[edit]alternative error messages: the jvm could not be started. the main method may have thrown an exceptionthis is often caused by one of two things1) exe4j (the vuze launcher) is finding the wrong java versionopen a command prompt and change directory into the directory containing the vuze executable. by default this will be cd "c:\program files\vuze"or cd "c:\program files (x86)\vuze"then set an environment variable to enable log file creation: set exe4j_log=yesfinally run vuze azureus.exethis will create a log file starting with the name i4j_nlog_in your temporary directory - to find this directory type cd%temp%check the log file to see if you can work out what went wrong2) you have created a .vmoptions file with invalid entries (e.g. a vm memory size that is too large). there are two places that this can reside: c:\program files\vuze or c:\program files (x86)\vuzeand %appdata%\azureusif you find a azureus.exe.vmoptions file in any of these locations, delete them and see if that fixes itmac os x[edit] java for mac os x 10.7 update 1 (december 2011): java for mac os x 10.6 update 6 (december 2011): java for mac os x 10.5 update 10 (june 2011): (for mac os x 10.4.5 or later): j2se 5.0 release 4 (ppc): j2se 5.0 release 4 (intel): mac to use the correct java[edit]you should be able to change the preferred java version *for applications* by using the java preferences utility. make sure that java 6 is the first in the list, before java 5 or 4.linux[edit]most linux variants include sun java by default. it is also possible that there are additional java variants packaged in the linux release.to find out which version is installed in your system, run the command java -version.the following instructions will help you install java, e.g., if you got back "command not found", or if you want to upgrade java.the following links lead to advice specific to different linux variants.on fedora redhat enterprise with gcj[edit]azureus 2.4.0.0 and greater may run with gcj 4.1.0 or greater, however some people experience problems which does not occur with the j2se version.other resources[edit]read the azureus faq.see also: jar retrieved from category: technical information navigation menu personal tools create accountlog in namespaces page discussion variants views read edit view history actions search download vuze now navigation main page recent changes random page help tools what links here related changes special pages printable version permanent link page information this page was last modified on 26 february 2014, at 19:14. this page has been accessed 76,797 times. about vuzewiki any use of vuze and vuze+ that violates the rights of any person or entity is not allowed. more
