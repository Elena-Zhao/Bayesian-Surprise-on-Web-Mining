condition for a prime number. prime number in java this java programming tutorial, we will be read how to get prime number between 1 to given number. first of all we have to define a class primenumber. java oop concept oop in java object oriented programming or oop is the technique to create programs based on the real world. unlike procedural programming, here in the oop programming model programs are organized around objects and data rather than actions and logic. java examples exception handling in example exception, that means exceptional errors. actually exceptions are used for handling errors in programs that occurs during the program execution. java identifier example in this example you will learn what is identifier and primitive data type of a identifier. this tutorials will teach you how to use these identifier in you java programming. java - variable, constant and literal in java variable : you can assign the values to the variable once it has beendeclared. the values of the variable can be changed anywhere in the program ifthe variable is accessible in that scope. in this example we have used thevariable intvariable to illustrate this. java read file example in the section of java tutorial you will learn how to write java program to read file line by line. we will use the datainputstream class to read text file line by line. copy

file name as parameter and it counts the number of words and lines present in the file. applet example in java applet is a program provided by java which is designed for execution within the web browser. applets are mostly used for a small internet and intranet applications because of small size and it's compatibility among almost all web browsers. boolean expression in java in this example you will see that how the expression returns a boolean value which is either true or false. this example illustrates you how to make a boolean expression by using relational operators and how to use the returned value of the expression. math class example in this example you will learn about math class. this example explains how you can use functions provided by the math class like e, pi, round, abs, ceil, exp, floor, ieeeremainder, max, min, pow, random, rint, sqrt etc. to manipulate the mathematical operation in your program. string buffer example in this example you will learn about stringbuffer class. this example explains how you can use functions provided by the stringbuffer class like append, insert, reverse, setcharat, charat, length, deletecharat, substring, delete, capacity etc. to manipulate the string operation in your program. type casting example this example illustrates that what is type casting? type casting refers to changing an entity of one datatype into another. this is important for the type conversion in developing any application. java - array in java array: array is the most important thing in any programming language.by definition, array is the static memory allocation. it allocates the memoryfor the same data type in sequence. it contains multiple values of same types. copying an array to another in this tutorial, you will learn how to copy data from one array to another. here, providing you an example with code and its explanation to given below. charat() method in java in this section, you will get the detailed explanation about the charat()method of string class. we are going for using charat() method. length() method in java in this section, you will learn how to use length()method of the string class. we are going to using length() method. touppercase() method in java here, you will see the procedure of converting letters of the string in uppercase letter. string array in java in this section, you will learn how to use string array in java. here, you will see how to declare a string array and the syntax for using in the program. average of array in this section, we will learn how to get an average of array. for this, first of all we have to define a class name arrayaverage that has double type array to contain some values. matrix example in java in java tutorial, you will learn about array and matrix. an array is the collection of same data type values. if we create a variable of integer type then, the array of int can only store the int values. sum of two matrix in this section, we are going to calculate the sum of two matrix and containing its rows and columns. see below for better understanding to this. multiplication of two matrix this is a simple java program that teaches you for multiplying two matrix to each other. here providing you java source code with understanding the java developing application program. square elements of two dimensional array this is a simple java program for implementing the two dimensional array program and its square. this session provide you the best explanation with mathematical operation. check even-odd:-example now, you have to learn about the syntax of if - else construct. how the if -else construct used to flow the program control as for as needed. java - break statement in java break: the break statement is used in many programming languagessuch as c, c++, java etc. some times we need to exit from a loop beforethe completion of the loop then we use break java - continue statement in java continue: the continue statement is used in many programming languagessuch as c, c++, java etc. sometimes we do not need to execute some statementsunder the loop then we use the continue statement that stops the normal flow ofthe control and control returns to the loop without executing the statementswritten after the continue statement. java - the switch construct in java switch is the control statement in java which also turns the normal flowcontrol of the program as per conditions. it works same as if-elseconstruct. this is the difference between switchand if-else construct that switch is usedfor reduce the if statements. switch statement example in java this is very simple java program for implementing the switch statement. here, you will learn how to use the switch statement in your java program for developing java application. while loop loop is the control statement of any language in which whenever you want to perform the repetitious work then youuse the loop controlstatement. do-while loop in java in some conditions in java, you need to run some statements and processesonce at least. for that you have to use the do while loop in after that check the condition then we use the do-while loopstatement. for loop in java the for loop is the type of looping construct. it also works as while loopconstruct but it provide the initialization, condition and the incrementis same written in the for construct. java - class, object and methods in java class : whatever we can see in this world all the things are a object.and all the objects are categorized in a special group. that group is termed as a class. java - constructor in java constructor is the method which name is same to the class. but there aremany difference between the method (function) and the constructor. constructor overloading in java constructors are used to assign initial values toinstance variables of the class. a default constructor with no arguments will becalled automatically by the java virtual machine (jvm). use of this keyword in java the keyword this is useful when you needto refer to instance of the class from its method. java - threads in java thread is the feature of mostly languages including java. threads allow theprogram to perform multiple tasks simultaneously. process speed can be increasedby using threads because the thread can stop or suspend a specific runningprocess and start or resume the suspended processes. occurrences of elements in an array this section illustrates you how to calculate occurrencesof elements in an array. occurrences means, the how many times an element occursin the array. changethe user input to integer isn't it avery tedious job to enter the values each time before the compilation in themethod itself. now if we want to enter an integer value after the compilation ofa program and force the jvm to ask for an input, then we should useinteger.parseint(string str) . making tokens of a string we have to break a string into tokens as well aswe will know how many tokens has been generated. that's what we are trying to doin this program. array list example in java in this example we are going to show the use of java.util.arraylist. we will be creatiing an object of arraylist class and performs various operations like adding removing the objects. converting a filename to a url a file object is used to a give a filename. creating the file object doesn't mean that a file exists. it may be that the does not exist. suppose if the file exists, first of all we need to convert the file object in url, for this we use a method tourl(). it returns a url object and throws malformedexception. after this we will convert this url to a file object by using getfile() method. we will read this file by using bufferedreader object. creating a temporary file in this program we are going to make a temporary file, which will be deleted automatically by the garbage collector when the program ends. example of date class we can use date class to use current date. in this program we are creating a date object and by using it we are going to display the current date and time. it implements serializable, cloneable, comparable interfaces. its known subclasses are date, time, timestamp. determining if two filename paths refer to the same file. this program is going to determine that the file name refers to the same file or not. what you need to do is to create two file object and pass the file name in the constructor of both the file class. now match both the file instances. it will return false if the file paths are not equal. to send the true value we first have to normalize both the paths, only after that it will return true. determining if a filename path is a file or a directory you can solve this problem very easily. what you need to do, just create a file object and pass some file name or a directory in it. determining if a file or directory exist this is a very simple problem. you just have to determine whether a file or directory exists or not. ifit exists itreturns trueotherwise in the else condition,it retunes vice-versa. forcing updates to a file to the disk in this program we are going to update a file forcefully. firstly we have to make an object of outputstream and pass a file name in which you want to update in the constructor of a fileoutputstream class. after that pass some data to the stream. the methods we are using in this class has already been discussed in other topics. link list example in java in this example we are going to show the use of java.util.linkedlist class. you will be creating an object of link list class and performing various operation like adding and removing object. listing the file system roots in this example we will list out all the drives in the disk. this requires an array of file class where all the drives will get stored by using only one method. reading a file into a byte array in this program we will read a file in the form of a byte array. we can do it very easily. firstly we will create an object of file class and pass the name of the file which we want to read, in the constructor of file class. we will use datainputstream to read primitive data types. implementing a serializable singleton in singeton classes only one instance will be created. we are going to serialize the class. this can be done very easily. what we need to do is to implement a java.io.serializable interface. we will use a method of serializable interface that is readresolve(). example of java stack program stack is like a bucket we you can enter objects and retrieve it. here in the example describes the methods to prepare an example of java stack program. the stack class represents a last-in-first-out (lifo) stack of objects. it extends class vector and implements cloneable, collection, list, serializable interfaces. we mostly use push and pop operations. vector example in java in this example we are going to show the use of java.util.vector class. we will be creating an object of vector class and performs various operation like adding, removing etc. vector class extends abstractlist and implements list, randomaccess, cloneable, serializable. the size of a vector increase and decrease according to the program. vector is synchronized. calculating the checksum of a file/adler32 adler32: it is a error checking technique used to check the accuracy of data while transmitting it to the other end. errors are checked while the data is transferring. this scheme is as reliable as crc32, but it is much faster to compute. calculating the checksum of the file/crc32 crc: crc means cyclic redundancy check. it is a error checking technique used to check the accuracy of data while transmitting it to the other end. errors are checked while the data is transferring. crc performs some type of calculation before transmitting the data and send the result to the other end. the other end repeats the same operation before accepting the data. if both the devices get the result same, it means the transmission is error free. compressing the file into gzip format. this example will help to understand the concepts of gzip. gzip compresses the actual size of data files. it is a file compression utility program which can be found very easily found on internet. its resultant file will have a .gz extension. its main advantage is that it provides excellent levels of compression. it can be used where you want to save the file in less available area. it will compress the file to the great extent. it is a part of java.util.zip package. constructing a file name path this java programming tutorial will teach you how you can construct a file name path. by using the constructing filename path it is possible to set dynamic path, which is helpful for mapping local file name with the actual path of the file. use of array in java this java programming example will teach you the the concepts of arrays so that you can write a program on array by yourself. an array works a container object which can hold a values of same type. the length of an array is created when the array is going to be created. arrays can be created in following ways. one way to create a array is by using new operator. e.g.. : a = new int[5];. it will create an array of type int which can store 5 integer values. the next way to define array is just same as we have defined an array in the program below. array should be used, where you have to store multiple values of the same type. for example if we have to store months of the year then the better idea is to make an array of it. example of static method this java programming example will teach you the way to define a static methods. in java we have two types of methods, instance methods and static methods. static methods can't use any instance variables. the this keyword can't be used in a static methods. you can find it difficult to understand when to use a static method and when not to use. if you have a better understanding of the instance methods and static methods then you can know where to use instance method and static method. uncompressing the file in the gzip format. this example will help you to understand the concepts of gzip. sometimes it happens that when you download a file or any pdf file you get it in compressed mode. this means that the file is compressed, but can't read it in compressed form so, it needs to be uncompressed. there are various uncompress ion utility program which can be found very easily found on internet. if you are uncompressing a pdf with the extension .gz, then its resultant file will have a .pdf extension. its main advantage is that it will uncompress the pdf file so that you can be able to read it. this utility is a part of java.util.zip package which provides classes and methods to compress and decompress the file. example of a instance variable when a number of objects are created from the same class, the same copy of instance variable is provided to all. remember, each time you call the instance the same old value is provided to you, not the updated one . in this program we are showing that how a instance variable is called in each instance, but the copy remains same irrespective the counter we have used in the constructor of a class. we can't call the non-static variable in a main method. if we try to call the non-static method in the main method then the compiler will prompt you that non-static variable cannot be referenced from a static context. we can call the non-static variable by the instance of the class. example of a class variable (static variable) this java programming example will teach you how you can define the static class variable in a class. when a number of objects are created from the same class, each instance has its own copy of class variables. but this is not the case when it is declared as static static. swapping of two numbers this java programming tutorial will teach you the methods for writing program to calculate swap of two numbers. swapping is used where you want to interchange the values. this program will help you to increase your programming ability. swap two any numbers (from keyboard) this is a simple java oriented language program. if you are newbie in java programming then our tutorial and example are helpful for understanding java programming in the simplest way. calculating the checksum of a byte array by using adler32 adler32: it is a error checking technique used to check the accuracy of data while transmitting it to the other end. errors are checked while the data is transferring. this scheme is as reliable as crc32, but it is much faster to compute.the byte is an 8- bit signed primitive data type quantity. the minimum value the byte is -128 and maximum value is +128. it is signed because it can take both negative and positive value. the byte class wraps a value of primitive type byte in an object. a object of type byte contains a single field whose type is byte. calculating the checksum of a byte array by using crc32 crc32: it is a error checking technique used to check the accuracy of data while transmitting it to the other end. errors are checked while the data is transferring. comparing the file dates this java example will help you to compare the dates of files. in java we have the option to compare two or more files. this is useful when we have to compare the files. mostly it happens that after creating a file or a directory we forgets when it was made or last modified, and sometimes it becomes essential to know the exact date and time of creation. by this example you will be able to understand it. getting a absolute path to find a file or directory it is very necessary to know the path of the file or directory so that you can access it. if you know the path then it is very easy to work on it. suppose a situation where a problem comes in front you where you don't know the path of the file, then what will you do. then this problem can be solved by using a method getabsolutepath(). the method getabsolutepath() should be used where we don't know the exact path of the file. making tokens of a java source code if you are new in java programming then our tutorials and examples will be helpful in understanding java programming in the most simplest way. here after reading this lesson, you will be able to break java program into tokens. add two big numbersin this section, you will learn how to add two bignumbers. for adding two numbers implement two big decimal numbers then apply the sum()
